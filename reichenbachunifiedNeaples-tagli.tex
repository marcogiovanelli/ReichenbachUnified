\subsection{A Parting of The Ways. Positivists and Metaphysicians}
\label{positivistsmetaphysicians}

On \datef{30}{1}{1929}, Einstein's rumored new derivation of the \FP-field equations was published in the Proceedings of the Berlin Academy with the ambitious tile \citetitle{Einstein1929b} \citep{Einstein1929b}. Despite his anger toward Reichenbach's \scare{leaks}, Einstein did not hesitate to feed the hopes of the general public by popularizing his new theory in the daily press. On \datef{2}{2}{1929}, in its section \citet{Nature1929}, \emph{Nature} reported an interview of Einstein published in the \jt{Daily Chronicle}, on \datef{26}{1}{1929}, a day after the publication of Reichenbach's infamous article in the \VZ. Einstein's quarrel with Reichenbach had deeper philosophical roots that went way beyond questions of academic etiquette. A few days later, Einstein wrote a popular account of the new theory \citep{Einstein1929-02-03}. Its English translation was published on the first page of their Sunday supplement of the \jt{New York Times} on \datedm{3}{2}{1929} and in \jt{The Times} of London in two installments on \datedm{4}{2}{1929} and \dated{5}{2}{1929} \citepp{Einstein1929-2-3}{Einstein1929-2-4}[also published as][]{Einstein1930h}. Einstein insisted on the highly speculative nature of \uftp, pointed out that this \q{speculative method} was the same that lead to to success of \gr. Start from a suitable field-structure and search for the most simple equations that govern this structure. In trying to defend this epistemological stance, Einstein was not afraid endorsing even his somewhat outrageous comparison with Hegel.

%In the paper after providing an overview of his work on relativity, he described the method that guided him to his last field theory. 
%Einstein insisted on \qt{the degree of formal speculation, the slender empirical basis, the boldness in theoretical construction, and finally the fundamental reliance on the uniformity of the secrets of natural law and their accessibility to the speculative intellect}{spekulativ-formalistische Zug, die Schmalheit der Erfahrungsbasis[,] die Kühnheit der theoretischen Konstruktion, das ihr zugrunde liegende Vertrauen in die Einheitlichkeit und die Durchdringbarkeit der Geheimnisse der Naturgesetzlichkeit durch die spekulative Vernunft} \citep[114]{Einstein1930h}. This \q{speculative method}, Einstein claimed, was the same that lead to to success of \gr: \qt{Which are the simplest formal structures that can be attributed to a four-dimensional continuum, and which are the simplest laws that may be conceived to govern these structures?}{Welches sind die einfachsten und natürlichsten Bedingungen, welchen ein Kontinuum der skizzierten Art unterworfen werden kann? Die Beantwortung dieser Frage, welche ich in einer neuen Arbeit [7] versucht habe, liefert einheitliche Feldgesetze für Gravitation und Elektromagnetismus} \citep[115]{Einstein1930h}. In trying to defend this epistemological stance, Einstein was not afraid to side with \qt{Meyerson in his brilliant studies on the theory of knowledge}, who had emphasized the \scare{Hegelian} nature of such enterprise, \qt{without thereby implying the censure which a physicist would read into this}{geistreiche Erkenntnisstheoretiker Meyerson die geistige Einstellung der Relativitats-Theoretiker mit derjenigen Descartes und sogar Hegels verglichen ohne indes mit jenem Vergleich jenen Tadel zu verbinden, den das Ohr eines Physikers haturgemass heraushoren wird} \citep[115]{Einstein1930h}. 

The fact Einstein chose to mention Meyerson rather than Reichenbach as a philosophical reference in a popular presentation of his last theory for a major newspaper has of course a quiete symbolic significance. After a decade of personal friendship and intellectual exchange that had shaped the history of 20th-century philosophy of science and Einstein seems to have put into question the very core of his philosophical alliance with Reichenbach. Whereas Reichenbach considered the separation between mathematics and physics the great achiement of the theory, Einstein to consider mathematical simplicity the guide to the unification of the two fields. Einstein was fully aware of the marginality of his position, but, throughout 1929, continued express his confidence in \FP program \citep{Einstein1930c}.

%After 1919 Einstein benefited from a universal acclaim among the general public; however his positions among the physics community became progressively more isolated. Till 1925-1926 the \uftp was pursued by scholars of the stature by Weyl and Eddington, but was also regarded as a viable options by leading quantum theoreticians \citep[209]{Vizgin1994}. Even, after the 1925--1927 rapid advance in \qm, were made of relate unified theories to quantum theory \citep{Klein1926a}. However, most leading physicists  soon started to perceive the program as obsolete. 

%Einstein was fully aware of the marginality of his position, but, throughout 1929, continued express his confidence in \FP program. In the second paper of this year finished in \datem{19}{8}{1929}---the fourth in the series in the Berlin Academy---which reflects the priority dispute with Élie Cartan \citep{Debever1979}, Einstein returned to the Hamiltonian principle after objections raised by his collaborators Lanczos and Müntz \citep{Einstein1930c}.  In spite of the many doubts, Einstein was finally convinced that he had \q{found the simplest legitimate characterization of a Riemannian metric with distant parallelism that can occur in physics} \letterp{Einstein}{Cartan}{25}{8}{1929}[\D{V}][Debever1979].

However, like Reichenbach, fellow physicists were not impressed, in particular given the growing success of \qm-program. 

Weyl, who had always been scolded by Einstein for his speculative style of doing physics could relaunch the accusation in a paper \citep{Weyl1929c} in which he had uncovered the gauge symmetry of the Dirac theory of the electron \citepp{Dirac1928}{Dirac1928b}. \q{The hour of your revenge has come}, Pauli wrote to Weyl in August: \qt{Einstein has dropped the ball of distant parallelism, which is also pure mathematics and has nothing to do with physics and \emph{you} can scold him}{jetzt hat Einstein den Bock des Fernparallelismus geschossenf , der auch nur reine Mathematik ist und nichts mit Physik zu tun hat, und Sie konnen schimpfen} \letterpaulip{Pauli}{Weyl}{26}{8}{1929}[235].  \cop{Although Einstein's papers had been discussed widely especially among mathematicians, Einstein was aware of the poor reception that his work had especially among the colleagues that he probably felt has his peers} \citep{Goldstein2003}. As Pauli complained, writing to Einstein's close friend Paul \Ehr, \q{God seems to have left Einstein completely!} \letterpaulip{Pauli}{\Ehr}{29}{9}{1929}[237].

%An invitation to the 1930 Rouse Ball lecture at Cambridge gave Weyl the opportunity to review the Whole development of matter concepts which had taken place during the long decade just coming to an end.





%\footnoteh{Einstein agreed and gave a talk on the Problem of Space, Field, and Ether in Physics on December 11, 1929, Essentially the same talk was delivered to a large audience on the opening day of the Second World Power Conference which took place in Berlin from 16–25 June, 1930.  The text of this lecture was then published in the conference’s Transactions [Einstein 1930d]. A similar popular account of Space, Ether and the Field in Physics was published in Forum Philosophicum [Einstein 1930c] together with an English translation. Indeed, the text of the two penultimate paragraphs of this version and [Einstein 1930d] that characterize the distant parallelism are identical. A two-page abbreviated version of [Einstein 1930c] also mentions the distant parallelism approach [Einstein 1930e]}

Nevertheless, Einstein continued to defend the theory in public (in talks given in October and December) \citep{Einstein1930,Einstein1930a,Einstein1930b}, as well as in as well in private correspondence. However, Pauli did not hesitate to describe Einstein's presentation at the Berlin Colloquium as a \qt{terrible rubbish}{schrecklichen Quatsch} \letterpaulip{Pauli}{Jordan}{30}{11}{1929}[238]. When he received the drafts of Einstein's \jt{Annalen} paper, he wrote only slightly more politely \cop{that he no longer believed that the quantum theory might be an argument for the distant parallelism after Weyl's work on Dirac theory had shown that Dirac’s electron theory could be incorporated into a relativistic gravitation theory if the \vbein are introduced but the equations remain invariant if the \vbein at distant points are rotated in arbitrary manner}. Pauli also wrote that he did not find the derivation of the ﬁeld equations convincing; they show \qt{no similarities with the usual facts confirmed by experience}{kaum eine Ahnlichkeit mit den gewohnlichen durch die Erfahrung gesicherten physikalischen Sachverhalten zu haben scheinen} \letterpaulip{Pauli}{Einstein}{19}{12}{1929}[239]. In particular, Pauli missed the validity of the classical tests of general relativity, perihelion motion and gravitational light bending: \qt{These results seem to be lost in your sweeping dismantling of the general theory of relativity. However, I hold on to this beautiful theory, even if it is betrayed by you!}{Die scheint doch bei Ihrem weitgehenden Abbau der allgemeinen Relativitatstheorie verloren zu gehen. Ich halte jedoch an dieser schonen Theorie fest, selbst wenn sie von Ihnen verraten wird!} \letterpaulip{Pauli}{Einstein}{19}{12}{1929}[239]. When Einstein expressed caution towards the definitive validity of his equations, he, \qt{so to speak, took the words right out of my mouth of criticism-loving physicists}{haben Sie den Kritik libenden Physikern sozusagen das Wort abgeschnitten} \letterpaulip{Pauli}{Einstein}{19}{12}{1929}[239]. Pauli knew that Einstein would not have changed his mind, but he was ready to \q{make any bet} that \q{after a year at the latest you will have given up all the distant parallelism, just as you had given up the affine theory before} \letterpaulip{Pauli}{Einstein}{19}{12}{1929}[239].

%\q{dann sagen Sie erst etwas dariiber, wenn mindestens ein Vierteljahr vergangen ist} 

Einstein complained that Pauli's remarks were superficial and asked him to return on the issue after some months \letterpaulip{Einstein}{Pauli}{19}{12}{1929}[140]. Although the \uftp was disavowed by its own initiators \citep{Weyl1931}, Einstein insisted in the pursuit of \FP discussing with Mayer two solutions of his last field equations \citep{Einstein1930g}\todo{field equations admitted at least one unphysical solution, namely, a static configuration of uncharged, gravitating bodies.}. However, Pauli would have clearly won the bet. Only a few months later Einstein and Walther Mayer presented a new approach \citep{Einstein1931} that, by generalizing the \nbein formalism to five dimensions, may have appeared more promising. This approach was ideally connected with that of Kaluza, but the shortcoming of that theory \qt{by sticking to the four-dimensional continuum, but with vectors with five components}{werden bei der im folgenden dargelegten Theorie dadurch vermieden, daß man zwar bei dem vierdimensionalen Kontinuum bleibt, aber in diesem Vektoren mit fünf Komponenten \textelp{} einführt} at each point of four-dimensional space-time \citep[377]{Einstein1931}. The optimism once again faded away quickly, since the theory was unable to solve the problem of matter. In a popular talk given in Vienna towards mid-\datemy{14}{10}{1931}, Einstein could only describe his field-theoretical work since \gr as a \qt{cemetery of buried hopes}{Friedhof von Begrabener Hoffnungen} \citep[441]{Einstein1932b}.

A few days later, Lanczos wrote to Einstein from the United States \letteraeap{Lanczos}{Einstein}{20}{10}{1931}[15-243] where he had just taken a position at Purdue University. Lanczos told Einstein that, at Arnold Berliner's suggestion, the influential editor of the \jt{Die Naturwissenschaften}, he had prepared a semi-popular presentation of \FP approach for the \jt{Ergebnisse der Exakten Wissenschaften}, a series sponsored by Berliner's journal \citep{Lanczos1931}. Lanczos had worked on the topic during his time as Einstein's assistant. The Lanczos/Einstein relation had become somehow strained \citep{Stachel1994}, and Lanczos was not fully convinced by Einstein's approach. However, he was confident to have found \q{a tone that should correspond to your conviction as well. I think that, deep down, we have something in common} \letteraeap{Lanczos}{Einstein}{20}{10}{1931}[15-243]. Lanczos presented \FP as a completion rather than an generalization of Riemannian geometry; nevertheless he also recognized the correctness of Reichenbach's approach \citep[118]{Lanczos1931}. What is more important, he opened the paper with some general considerations which give a glimpse in the philosophical atmosphere which pervaded the physics community. Lanczos distinguished between two \qt{spiritual attitudes}{geistige Haltung} towards relativity: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{p} a \emph{positivist-subjectivist} insistence that physics has to do with observable quantities, and what cannot be observed is not part of physics. This \q{rigorous and therefore more intolerant form of positivism} \citep[104]{Lanczos1931}, defended in particular by quantum theoreticians, lead to the rejection of the \uft program as such.\ Since a field is nothing but a tool to describe the behavior of test particles, \rac and so, it is vain to search for solutions of the field equations that correspond to protons and electrons. In fact, the fields inside of elementary particles \q{could never in their details become the object of observation} \citep[104]{Lanczos1931}, since there are no test particles or measuring scales smaller than the electron itself. 

\item\label{m} A \emph{metaphysical-realistic} perspective, based on the conviction that physical reality exists independently of the possibility of measuring or observing it. If \sr seemed to be close to the positivistic/operationalistic ideals, with \Mink the theory underwent a \qt{\scare{metaphysical} turn}{metaphysische Wandlung} in favor of a \qt{logical-constructive understanding \origins{Verstehen}}{zugunsten eines logisch-konstruktiven Verstehen} \citep[103]{Lanczos1931}. \Gr had finally brought \qt{the logical-deductive exploration into the depths of nature, under the presupposition of its universality and understandability, and with faith in the laws of mathematics}{das logisch-deduktive Eindringen in die Natur, unter Voraussetzung ihrer Universalitiit und Verstehbarkeit, und im Verlrauen au/ das mathematische Gesetz} \citep[102]{Lanczos1931}. 
\end{enumerate} 
%
The positivist described by Lanczos could be easily identified with Pauli, who had indeed raised similar objections against Weyl's theory early on \citepp{Pauli1919}[see][13]{Hendry1984}. However, Pauli,  by reviewing Lanczos article, did not fully recognize himself in the portrait of the \scare{positivist} \citep{Pauli1932-3-11}. Such labels, he argued, \q{are highly subjective and arbitrary}; it is obvious that in order to gain new scientific insights one does not only requires inductive generalizations, but also logical-constructive imagination. Pauli mocked the \emph{Naturwissenschaften} for having published the paper in series entitled \scare{Results in exact sciences} (\german{Ergebnisse der Exakten Wissenschaften}). Indeed, Einstein published this sort of theories at rhythm of one each year and in every case he claims that it is the definitive solution: \qt{Einstein's new field theory is dead, long live Einstein's new theory!}{Die neue Feldtheorie ~EINSTEINS ist tot. ES Iebe die neue Feldtheorie EINSTEINS !}. 


%However, it was undeniable that many supporters of \qm had used a a positivistic rhetorics, and it was against this rhetorics that Einstein, somehow tongue in cheek, was not ashamed to define himself as a metaphysician \citep{Einstein1932a}. It was this attitude that caught many of Einstein's philosophical allies by surprise.\todo{improve}


%Lanczos was meant probably the Pauli-Einstein debate, a more general the reaction of Einstein's philosophical\todo{improve}. 

However, if many readers might have easily recognized someone like Pauli in Lanczos's \scare{positivist}, other were baffled to find out Einstein located among the \scare{metaphysicians}. At the beginning of 1932 the introduction of Lanczos's 1931 paper was published at Berliner's suggestion as a \latin{seperatum} in the \citejournal{Lanczos1932} \q{to make it available to a larger public} \citep[113\fn{1}]{Lanczos1932}. It is probably this article of Lanczos that Frank read with some bewilderment, as he reports in his Einstein's biography \citep{Frank1947}. Frank was \q{quite astonished} to find the theory of relativity characterized as the expression of a realist program \q{since I had been accustomed to regarding it as a realization of \Mach's program} \citep[215]{Frank1947}. However, when Frank met Einstein in Berlin at around the same time, he found out that Lanczos had indeed well characterized Einstein's point of view \citep[215f.]{Frank1947}. According to his recollection, Einstein complained that \q{\textins{a} new fashion} had arisen in physics according to which quantities that in principle cannot be measured do not exist, and that to \q{to speak about them is pure metaphysics} \citep[216]{Frank1947}. Frank objected that this was the very same philosophical attitude that led to relativity theory. By contrast, Einstein insisted, the essential point of relativity theory is to \q{regard an electromagnetic or gravitational field as a physical reality, in the same sense that matter had formerly been considered so}  \citep[216]{Frank1947}. The theory of relativity teaches us the connection between different descriptions of one and the same reality. Was not a theory about the behavior of \rac, but a unification of two fields.


\q{In this connection we are likely to think of the development of the theory of relativity into a world geometry, yet it would be quite erroneous to interpret this development as signifying a fusion of physics and mathematics. The general theory of relativity by no means turns physics into mathematics. Quite the opposite: it brings about the recognition of a physical problem of geometry. \citep Although both mathematics and physics are sciences, the difference between them is fundamental, and we must put it down as quite impossible that it will ever disappear. For mathematics is not a natural science at all.}

%\footnote{Einstein used a similar wording by commenting on the manuscript of Cassirer's \scare{Kantian} booklet on relativity. \q{Conceptual systems appear empty to me, if the manner in which they are to be referred to experience is not established} \lettercpaep{\Einstein}{\Cassirer}{6}{6}{1920}[10][44]. In particular, \q{[w]ith the interpretation of the $ds$ as a result of measurement, which is obtainable by means of measuring rods and clocks the general theory of relativity as a physical theory stands or falls} \lettercpaep{\Einstein}{\Cassirer}{6}{6}{1920}[10][44]. The gravitational redshift, can be taken as an empirical confirmation of general relativity only because different atoms of the same substance can be regarded as identically constructed clocks reproducing the identical unit of time. For this reason it is possible to \scare{normalize} the absolute value of $ds$ by counting the wave crests on atom. According, Weyl's theory deprived the $ds$ of any physical meaning. However, real \rac behave differently than predicted by Weyl theory forcing Weyl to assume an inconsistent position. According to Einstein, line \gr, Weyl's  \q{theory is based on a measuring rods geometry}, that is it presupposes the comparability of lengths. However, it entains only \q{thought measuring rods \origins{nur gedachte Massstäbe}} that behave differently from the real ones. \q{This is repugnant} \lettercpaep{\Einstein}{\Besso}{26}{8}{1920}[10][85\me]}. 


%The subsequent months will be of fundamental importance in Reichenbach's biography. A correspondence with Schlick in October 1920 seems to have convinced Reichenbach that us axioms of coordination were simply \scare{convetions}. Reichenbach seemed to have been concerned that this solution would have made deprived on any physical content. \cop{Reichenbach explains that the principle of simplicity – used by Poincaré and Schlick to choose the \scare{right} geometry – does not seem “univoque” to him. As a consequence, as far as the principle of simplicity is not involved, the “coordination principles” cannot be conventions, because there must be a “synthetic” criterion to decide which}. ust after the passage Reichenbach adds : “the alternative between the two conventions appears as synthetic knowledge”. It is possible that Einstein's endorsme moght have convied. That to resctrit the coordiantes, ultimately found tin the $G+P$ formula. However, that one has to seprate mathematics from physics will as constantn of Reichenbach's philosopjy. It is this point that not only his critisim of Weyl but also of the \uftp attempts\todp{.

%\cop{Ich freue mich wirklich sehr darüber, dass Sie mir Ihre ausgezeichnete Broschüre widmen wollen, noch mehr aber darüber, dass Sie mir als Dozent und Grübler ein so gutes Zeugnis ausstellen.

Begriffe sind eben leer, wenn sie aufhören, mit Erlebnissen fest verkettet zu sein. Sie gleichen Emporkömmlingen, die sich ihrer Abstammung schämen und sie verleugnen wollen}. Einstein made a similar claims by writing to Cassirer in the very same days.

%Widmung .That most of the discussion of the book, relativized constitutive \apr, however, one first by a philosophers of Weyl theory, and in particular was that is itself superior. 

%\footnote{In the discussions at the Bad Nauheim meeting, Einstein maintained his characteristically ambiguous attitude towards the role of rods and clocks in relativity theory. Commenting on \Weyl's talk, he pointed out once again that the \q{arrangement of \textins{his} conceptual system,} \q{it has become decisive \origins{massgebend} to bring elementary experiences into the language of signs \origins{Zeichensprache}} \citep[650]{Einstein1920c}. For Einstein, \q{temporal-spatial intervals are physically defined with the help of measuring rods and clocks}, under the assumption that \q{their equality is empirically independent of their prehistory} \citep[650]{Einstein1920c}. Einstein insisted that precisely upon this assumption rests \q{the possibility of coordinating \origins{zuzuordnen} a number $ds$ to two neighboring world points}; if this were impossible, general relativity would be robbed of \q{its most solid empirical support and possibilities of confirmation} \citep[650]{Einstein1920c}.
%
%However, Einstein showed a more flexible attitude replying to Pauli's remarks during the same discussion. \Pauli reiterated his objection based on his \scare{observability} criterion. Just as the field strength in the interior of the electron is meaningless because there is no smaller test particle than the electron, \q{one could claim something similar concerning spatial measurements, \myemph{since there are no infinitely small measuring-rods}} \citep[650]{Einstein1920c}. Einstein replied to \Pauli that \q{with the increasing refinement of the system of scientific concepts, the manner and procedure of associating the concepts with experiences becomes increasingly more complicated} \citep[650]{Einstein1920c}. In particular, he recognized that in cases such as that of the continuum theories, \q{one finds that a definite experience cannot be associated any longer with a concept} \citep[650]{Einstein1920c}. According to Einstein, there is an alternative: one can abandon \scare{continuum theories} for the sake of \Pauli's observability criterion, or replace such a \q{system of associating concepts \textins{with experiences} with a more complicated one} \citep[650]{Einstein1920c}.  Einstein's in his contributions to the the discussion which followed Max von \citets{Laue1920}'s Bad Nauheim paper. Einstein, however, in the very same sentence, did not hesitate to admit that \q{[it] is a logical shortcoming of the theory of relativity in its present form to be forced to introduce measuring rods and clocks \myemph{separately instead of being able to construct them as solutions to differential equations}} \citep[Einstein's reply to][662\me]{Laue1920}}.

Ultimately, it should only be permissible in physics when it can be established whether it applies in concrete cases of observation. This requirement does not seem far from the view that Einstein often defended in the past. However, Einstein realized that this requirement was too severe. In several writings of those years Einstein had repeatedly insisted geometry cannot be tested separately from physics \citep{Einstein1923}. Possible experiences, he claimed, must correspond not to an individual concept but to the system as a whole (\cite[1692]{Einstein1924}; \cf\cite{Giovanelli2014a}). Without an analogon of equivalence principle, the choice of the affine connection of as fundamental variable was not even physically motivated nor it had any physical meaning. However, if using the $\Gamma\tmn$ leads to the right set of field equations, then the use of $\Gamma\tmn$ as a fundamental variable is justified that lead to new results this choice can be justified \emph{post facto}. Only geometry and physics together could be compared with experience.

However, Einstein was still convinced that a field theory that might offer the solution to the quantum problem \citep{Einstein1923f} was at least \qt{a logical \emph{possibility}, to do justice to reality without \emph{sacrificium intellectus}}{\latin{sacrificium intellectus} der Wirklichkeit gerecht zu werden} 	\lettercpaep{Einstein}{Besso}{5}{1}{1924}[14][190], that is, without retreating to a positivist-phenomenalist agnosticism.  Einstein distanced himself from the logical positivists' insistence on the need to coordinate every fundamental concept of a theory to a \q{piece \originsg{Ding} of reality} \citeptra[5]{Reichenbach1924}[8]{Reichenbach1969}, although they did not seem to have taken notice. However, the more rationalistic attitude of neo-Kantian philosophers like Ernst \citet{Cassirer1921} and his followers \citepp{Winternitz1923}{Elsbach1924} did not seem to offer a valid alternative \citepp{Einstein1924a}{Einstein1924}. According to Einstein, science extensively uses non-empirical \scare{ideal} conceptual constructions (say the \gmn, the $\Gamma\tmn$, etc.) \citep[1691]{Einstein1924}.

I think that this hybrid definition of length is undesirable,}. 


%In the original presentation of \rt, Einstein started the metric $\gmn$ a coordinate indent criterion of the equality distance $ds$ of two nearby points  with coordinates $x_\nu$ and $x_\nu+dx_\nu$, the famous formula for the line element $ds^2=$. In the lectures, Einstein showed how one treat $dx_\nu$ as a special case of contravariant vector $A^\tau$. The so called affine connection $$dA^\tau = \Gtmn A^\mu dx_\nu$$ provides a coordinate-independent criterion for the parallelism of two vectors at neighboring points $x_\nu$ and $x+dx_\nu$ are equal and parallel. It can be show, that the notion of \scare{sameness} cannot be in general be extended to distant points by continuous transfer along curve. If one parallel displaces along different paths, one gets, in general, a different vector at a distant point \citep[028-01-03, 37]{HR}. In this way one could recover the notion of \scare{curvature} without any reference to the metric. The metric could be introduced at later stage by associating with any contravariant vector $A^\tau$ with a length $l^2=\gmn A^\mu A^\nu$. It was natural to assume that the length of vectors does not change under parallel transport. By imposing this condition Levi-Civita was able to recover the content Riemannian geometry. The line element $ds$ is nothing but the length $l$ of the contra-variant vector $dx^\nu$. 

Although not mention of this point is made in the notes, from discussions with Einstein, Reichenbach might have become immediately aware that \citep{Weyl1918a,Weyl1919a} was bothered by asymmetry comparison of direction of vectors which is path-dependent could not be the comparison their lengths was distant-geometrical. To overcome this \scare{mathematical injustice}, Weyl a introduced \scare{metric connection} alongside the \scare{affine connection}. If a vector of length $l$ is displaced from $x_\nu$ to $x_\nu+dx_\nu$, it will in general have a new length $l+dl$, so that $dl/l=\phin dx_\nu$. In this way, in addition to the \scare{metric tensor} \gmn, a \scare{metric vector} $\phin$ is introduced:


The \gmn are identified with the potentials of the gravitational field because of a \emph{physical fact} the equivalence principles. Weyl found natural to intepret \phin as the four-potential of electromagnetic field  because of the \emph{mathematical fact} that the tensor $F\mn$ is the curl of the \phin, and in turn constraint equivalent to Maxwell equations. Via the action principles from \gmn and \phin Weyl hoped was able to recover Maxwell and a set gravitational field equations. Weyl was initially confident  the stable solutions of the equations corresponding to elementary particles, allowing the ultimate comparison with experience.



Weyl could then conclude that just like general relativity represented a geometrization of gravitational phenomena, Weyl's theory represented a unified geometrization of both gravitational and electromagnetic phenomena, which were, at that time, the only kind known. Ultimately, matter itself would have become epiphenomenon of the \scare{world metrics}. With some rhetorical exaggeration, Weyl did not hesitate to declare \q{Der Traum des Descartes von einer rein geometrischen Physik} had be fulfilled. Concluding the 1919 edition of the book, Weyl could declare that \q{physics and geometry coincide with each other}. The tendency of physicalizing geometry that have prevailed leading protagonists of the 19th century from Gauss to Helmholtz seemed to superseded have of geometrizing physics that run from Riemann to Einstein: \q{geometry has not been physics but physics has become geometry} \citep[263]{Weyl1919}. 


%The functions $g_{\mu \nu}$ are to be determined in such a way that with the chosen coordinates $d s^{2}=\pm 1$ or 0, respectively, for all mesh points \citeptra[5]{Reichenbach1924}[8]{Reichenbach1969}. If it is impossible to find a coordinate systems. The we have two alternatives the rods are deformed by force that affect all bodies in the sawy way; the gometry of space is non-Euclidean. Of course.



%Reichenbach, as others, probably found the entire procedure questionable. From later by Reichenbach, was again not dissimilar to that of Pauli had confessed in along to Pauli. A good theory should  should first how the field quantities could be measured, an the derived other field quantities. On the contrary, he starts from the \Gtmn that non physical meaning and cannot be measured if not inprinciples, could only  and the measurable derfivanle from the \Gtmn. 




%Without an analogon of equivalence principle, the choice of the affine connection of as fundamental variable was not even physically motivated nor it had any physical meaning. They serve only to construct a suitable Lagrangian, from which the field equations could be derived. The correctness of the theory hat is to observe would lead to solutions corresponding to known elementary particles and their behavior.  

%Einstein, why he was skeptical of Weyl's approach. Weyl's theory was semi-metrical. It assumed the comparability of lengths, although only at neighboriung. Howevr, to claim that measuring instrumetns that serve measure behave differently that the geometry would predict. This inconsistency was for Einstein unacceptable. Einstein considered preferable to adopt Eddington purely affine approach in which the \Gtmn iwhtout introduing any relation between the affine connection and the metric. From the affine connection alone one can derive an in general non-symmetric Ricci tensor, the symmetric of which would be identified with metric tensor up to a constant.  


%This allowed him to construt Ricci tensor Wir führen aber von Anfang an gar keine Voraussetzung ein über einen Zusammenhang zwischen affinem Zusammenhang und Metrik.

%In his eyes, physics seemed to be transformed to a purely formal status and was absorbed by geometry. Matter had seemingly become an epiphenomenon of the "world metrics" which started to acquire a slightly mystical flavour





One can think of $d\xn$ as the components of a (contravariant) vector $A^\tau$, $n$ numbers $A^\mu$ ($A^1, A^2, A^3, A^4) that we associate with some point $P$ and transform as per certain rules by the change of coordinates. In Euclidean geometry, it is always possible to introduce a Cartesian coordinate system in which two vectors are equal and parallel when they have the same components. However, this relation does not hold if we introduce curvilinear coordinates, \eg polar coordinates. Although parallel vectors are still parallel in the new coordinate system, the equality of the components of two parallel vectors attached to two different points in space is not preserved. \Eg consider two unit vectors $A^\tau$  and $A^{*\tau}$ on a plane pointing along the $x$ direction: one at the point at $(0,1)$ and another at $(1,0)$ in Cartesian coordinates. In this coordinate system, $A^\tau$  and $A^{*\tau}$ have the same components, \ie they are equal and parallel. However, in polar coordinates $r,\vartheta$ (where $r$ represents distance from the origin, and $\vartheta$ represents the angle that the point makes with the origin and the positive $x$-axis), $A^\tau$ has only a $r$ component, whereas $A^{*\tau}$ has only a $\vartheta$ component. Nevertheless, they are still equal and parallel. Indeed, the vector $A^*\tau$ can be obtained by displacing $A^\tau$ parallel to itself along a circle. In polar coordinates, the components $A^\tau$ change at each point even though its length and direction remain the same

In Euclidean geometry, it is always possible to introduce a Cartesian coordinate system in which two vectors are equal and parallel when they have the same components. However, this relation does not hold if we introduce curvilinear coordinates, \eg polar coordinates. Consequently, vectors at different points can no longer be directly compared. If one displaces a vector to a neighboring point $dx_\nu$, one does not know whether the vector has remained the \scare{same} by simply examining its components. The \scare{connection} (\german{Zusammenhang}) from a point to another is lost. Because the affine geometry is the study of parallel lines, \citet{Weyl1918b} used to speak of the necessity of establishing an \scare{affine connection} (\german{affiner Zusammenhang}). However, because it is a relation of \scare{sameness} rather than parallelism that is relevant in this context, others, such as Reichenbach, prefer to speak of the operation of \scare{displacement} (\german{Verschiebung}), where the latter indicates the small coordinate difference $d\xn$ along which the vector is transferred. 


To reinstate the \scare{connection} one requires to introduce a rule for comparing vectors at infinitesimally separated points. Given a vector $A^\tau$ at \xn in an arbitrary coordinate system, we need to determine the components of the vector $A^{\ast\tau}$ at $\xn+d\xn$ that is to be considered the \scare{same vector} as the given vector $A^\tau$. The vector $A^{\tau}$ at the point $P\left(x^{\nu}\right)$ and the vector $A^{\tau}+d A^{\tau}$ at the point $P^{\ast}\left(x^{\nu}+d x^{\nu}\right)$ are the \scare{same vector}, if they satisfy the condition:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:affine}
dA^\tau = \Gamma^\tau_{\mu\nu}A^{\mu} dx_\nu\,.
\end{equation}
%
The quantity $\Gamma^\tau_{\mu\nu}$ is known as the affine connection or displacement. It has three indices, i.e., entails $\tau$ possible combinations of $\mu \times \nu$ coefficients, which can vary arbitrarily from point to point, i.e., in the general case, are functions of $x_\nu$. Because in general $\Gtmn \neq \Gtnm$, the \Gtmn has $n \times n^2$ coefficients. If a vector $A^\tau$ is given at the point $P$ with coordinates \xn, \cref{eq:affine} yields the unknown components of the vector $A^{\ast\tau}$ at $P^*$ with coordinates $\xn+dx_\nu$. Continuing this process $
\xn+d\xn+d^{\ast} \xn+d^{\ast \ast} \xn \ldots$, we can parallel displace a vector from any given point to any other distant point. As is well known, the most characteristic feature of the operation of displacement is that if one parallel displaces $A^\tau$ along different paths, one gets, in general, a different vector $A^{\ast \tau}$ at a distant point:

It is naturally to assume that is symmetric. The displacement allows to establish whether two vectors are the \scare{same}, i.e., having the same length and the same direction. However, it does not provide a measure of the length of differently directed vectors. For this purpose, the notion of dot product of two vectors must be introduced, which, taking the components of the two vectors, returns a single number. In particular, the squared length $l$ of a vector is given by the dot product of the vector with itself $l^2$. In an arbitrary coordinate system, the latter takes the form:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:3}
l^2=\gmn A^\mu A^\nu\,,
\end{equation}
%
where the \gmn is the metric. If $A^\tau$ is considered to correspond to $dx_\nu$, \cref{eq:3} is nothing but \cref{eq:lineelement} and $l$ corresponds to $ds$. However, this notation is more general. One can take $A^\tau$ to be $dx^\nu/ds$, (where $ds$ is the \til interval, which is an element of the four-dimensional trajectory of a moving point), $l$ is the length of the four-velocity vector $u^\nu$. How much a vector varies, this is simple in the case that, covariant differentiation, a second term is necessary, that is that the covariant of the metric vanish


By imposing this condition, one obtains 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:riemannconnection}
\Gtmn=-\christoffel{\mu}{\nu}{\tau} =
\end{equation}
%

The components of \Gtmn have the same numerical values of the so-called Christoffel symbols of the second kind (up to a sign) because they are calculated from the metric \gmn and its first derivatives.




%\cop{Yet it is incorrect to conclude, like Weyl and Haas, that mathematics and physics are but one discipline. The question concerning the validity of axioms for the physical world must be distinguished from that concerning possible axiomatic systems. It is the merit of the theory of relativity that it removed the question of the truth of geometry from mathematics and relegated it to physics. If now, from a general geometry, theorems are derived and asserted to be a necessary foundation of physics, the old mistake is repeated. This objection must be made to Weyl's generalization of the theory of relativity which abandons altogether}.

Es wäre das deswegen besonders wertvoll, weil die Arbeit doch zum grossen Teil philosophischen Charakters ist, Herr Rei- chenbach sich aber für Physik habilitieren soll. Nun glaube ich, dass auch Sie mit mir übereinstimmen werden darin, dass gerade solche Arbeiten auch für den Phy- siker bei der augenblicklichen Entwicklung in der Physik sehr nützlich sind, sodass seine Arbeit auch dem Herrn Reichenbach zur Habilitation inder Physik dienen kann.

%Weyl's presentation was Pauli and Einstein, was included the 4th edition of Raum, Zeit, Materie (Weyl, 1921a) finished in November 1920, to explain ?the discrepancy between the idea of congruent transfer and the behavior of measuring-rods and clocks and atoms? (Weyl, 1921a, 280; tr. 1922a, 308).

The importance of this formalism for \gr was to which was the key content of the theory. Let's conisder the four-velocity of a particle $u^\tau=d\xn/d\ap$. By parallel-displacing a vector $u^\tau$ indicating the direction of a curve $\xn(\ap)$ at any of its points, one can define a special class of curves, the straightest lines. The operation of parallel transporting a vector $u^\tau$ along a curve $x(\ap)$ is expressed by the condition that the covariant derivatives of $u^\tau$ with respect to the parameter \ap vanish along the curve: $\frac{d u^{\tau}}{d \ap}-\Gtmn u^{\mu} \frac{d x^\nu}{d\ap}=0$. The vector $u^\tau$ indicates the direction of the curve $x_\nu(\ap)$ at each point if its components are proportional to the increments $dx_\nu$ along the curve, \ie if $u^\tau=d\xn/d\ap$. The curve traced by the parallel displacement of $u^\tau$ along its own direction $d\xn/d\ap$ is the straightest curve. According to special relativity, a freely movable body not subjected to external forces moves, according to the special theory of relativity, in a straight line and uniformly with respect to an inertial coordinate system $K$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:geodesicelectro}
\frac{d^{2} x_{\tau}}{d s^{2}} = 0
\end{equation}

If \ap is the so-called \scare{proper time}, $u^\tau$ as the velocity four-vector of a particle, and $\frac{d {u^\tau}}{d\ap}$ its acceleration. If now consider from the of a we can, that this is ultimately. If chose a suitable coordinate system that the right had sight of the equation vanish. Then if we introduce new space-time co-ordinates $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}$, by means of any substitution we choose, the go in this new system will no longer be constants, but functions of space and time.

\begin{equation*}
\frac{d {u^\tau}}{d\ap} - \Gtmn u^{\mu} u^\nu =0 
\end{equation*}
 
According to the equivalence principle $K$ and $K'$ is however, indistinguisblae from $K$. All fall with the same velocity, thus the non vanisihig of the \gmn. If the $\Gamma_{\mu \nu}^{\tau}$ vanish, then the point moves uniformly in a straight line. These quantities therefore condition the deviation of the motion from uniformity. They are the components of the gravitational field.


\begin{equation}\label{eq:riemanntensorgamma}
R_{\mu \nu \sigma}^{\tau}(\Gamma)=\frac{\partial \Gamma_{\mu \nu}^{\tau}}{\partial x^{\sigma}}-\frac{\partial \Gamma_{\mu \sigma}^{\tau}}{\partial x^{\nu}}+\Gamma_{\alpha \nu}^{\tau} \Gamma_{\mu \sigma}^{\alpha}-\Gamma_{\alpha \sigma}^{\tau} \Gamma_{\mu\sigma}^{\alpha}\,, = 0
\end{equation}
%
In the general case how, so that without changing its components. The physical hypothesis on which general relativity is based, on the fundamental idea that valid also in the case in which does not vanish. This difference, curvature of space. The vector would not return with the same components.

This point is essential to Reichenbach's argument. It was precisely because his toy-geometrization was not envied by its more titled competitors that Reichenbach believed himself to be in an excellent position to \qt{attack the view that with a geometrical presentation of electricity, one would already gain something}{Ich wollte mich eben mit meiner Darstellung gegen die Auffassung wenden, als ob mit der geometrischen Darstellung der Elektrizität an sich schon etwas gewonnen wäre}[\letter{Reichenbach}{Einstein}{4}{4}{1926}][20-086][EA]. For such a geometrical interpretation of electromagnetism to become a physical theory as successful as general relativity, more was required than a mere geometrization. It called for something \emph{new}. Howeve,r in this cas eht egometrizajo did provide any sucecs. Of course if one could to reight field equatios, im particular than wuld ha bene trasitwryt.


%%Thus, Reichenbach argued that the geometrical interpretation of a physical field can only be successful if it leads to a \scare{change} in the equations and does not simply rewrite in geometrical terms the equations that are already known. One could object that Weyl, Eddington and Einstein's theories also changed the equations and did not simply rewrite them. However, Reichenbach seems to consider the derivability of solutions that correspond to the electron as a litmus test for a real change in the field equations. Maxwell's field equations are valid in free space and cannot explain why the separate, equally charged parts do not fly apart without introducing a non-electromagnetic cohesion force (the so-called Poincar\'{e} stress). On the other hand, Einstein's field equations, in their original form, do not entail any effect of gravitation on charge and cannot provide the cohesion force. It is only by changing the currently available field equations that it would become  possible to establish a connection between \gmn and $f\mn$, thereby assuring the equilibrium of the electron.
%
%To fully understand Reichenbach's stance on this issue, one must keep in mind that in a paper published in April \citep{Reichenbach1926} he expressed strong skepticism about the possibility of solving the problem of the \scare{grainy} structure of matter and and most all of the \qt{proper quantum-riddle}{eigentlichen Quantenrätsels}[][424][Reichenbach1926] in a field-theoretical/geometrical context. In Reichenbach's view, the \qt{casuality \origins{Zufälligkeit}}{Zufälligkeit}[][424][Reichenbach1926] of the \scare{quantum jumps} (the transition between orbital energy levels in Bohr's atom) suggests that the problem should be tackled from a different angle, by considering whether the very notion of causality in physics should be replaced by that of probability \citep[424]{Reichenbach1926}. After all, one should appreciate Reichenbach's clairvoyance, considering that Max Born's paper \citep{Born1926a} on the statistical interpretation of the wave function appeared only in June\footnote{For Reichenbach's take on the emerging quantum mechanics at this time, see the posthumously published manuscript, \cite{Reichenbach1926e}}.

%Reichenbach attached to this letter a typewritten note. As we shall see, far more was at stake in it than a critique of Weyl's theory (which was generally considered a dead horse at the time). Reichenbach intended to call into question the very idea that, since general relativity has \scare{geometrized} the gravitational field, the obvious next move should be to try to \scare{geometrize} the electromagnetic field. The importance of this formalism for \gr was to which was the key content of the theory.

Thus, Weyl's theory should predict that would are not, also that to not tick at the same rate in the presence of the electromagnetic field. However, this is not the case. Indeed, have the same spectral lines. Any physical content. However, they theory has moreover further shortcomings. The trajectories of free uncharged particles are not geodesics (see, for instance, Doc. 579) in the theory because of the presence \phin in the definition of the connection. The field equations are of the fourth order which increased the degree of arbitrariness of such equations. \cop{Moreover, to find the laws of pure gravitation and of electromagnetism, it was necessary to define the Langrangian $\mathcal{H}$, composed of two absolutely independent parts. We thus had a dualism; to avoid it, he arrived at the solution mentioned}.

This led him to a variational principle that included the Einsteinian component (with the cosmological term), the in Einstein's cosmological model.) By following this path, Weyl arrived at unit of charge, the gravitational radius of which, has the same order of magnitude as the radius of the universe. Noting that, in his work, the unit of electricity and the unit of action both have "cosmic values," Weyl emphasized: '"'The 'cosmological' term that Einstein first added to his theory is a natural consequence of our original principles" (Weyl 1919,p. 124, italic in the original).

%In his 1919 paper, Weyl suggested a new variant of unified theory a that generalized GR and was based on a geometry that he introduced (i.e., the Weyl geometry). In this new theory, the gravitational Lagrangian remained the square of the curvature. The Maxwellian part of it, however, was no longer emerging in a natural way but was added "by hand." Through artful manipulations, Weyl managed to bring this Lagrangian into a quasi-Einsteinian form. This led him to a variational principle that included the Einsteinian component (with the cosmological term), the Maxwellian component, and a non-Maxwellian component, the square of the vector potential p,p' ("the simplest expression found in the Mie theory" (Weyl 1919, p. 122), a theory that claimed to provide a unified field description of the electron and the electromagnetic field).

%If one makes the first assumption in Weyl’s theory, Einstein argued, the rate of a clock will be dependent on its prehistory; if one makes the second, uncharged particles will be affected by the electromagnetic four-vector potential. In Doc. 661, Einstein reiterated both charges, that of the fourth-order and not of the second order}.  Einstein held the opinion that the world-lines of an uncharged particle should be described by a geodesic equation that does not explicitly depend on the electromagnetic four-potential, as it does in Weyl's theory.  \cop{This led him to separate the theory into two distinct parts: 1) the "pure, infinitesimal geometry," which provides a set of geometric structures \gmn and \phin.

\subsection{Reichenbach's Notes on Einstein's Lecture and the Notion of Parallel Transport of Vectors}


%Nach seinem Einsatz im Ersten Weltkrieg hörte Reichenbach in Berlin Einsteins Vorlesungen zur Speziellen und Allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie. Seine Mitschriften dieser Veranstaltungen sind erhalten geblieben: Klassische und Statistische Mechanik (SS 1918, HR-028-01-02), Allgemeine Relativitätstheorie (Teil 1 HR-018-0104, Teil 2 HR-028-01-03, Teil 3 HR-028-01-01, alle Tile undatiert). In Teil 1 der Mitschrift zur Allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie, behan- 1917--1918 and 1918-1919. His transcripts of these events have been preserved: Classical and Statistical Mechanics (SS 1918, HR-028-01-02), General Theory of Relativity (Part 1 HR-018-0104, Part 2 HR-028-01-03, Part 3 HR- 028-01-01, all tiles undated). 


%The introduction of the Riemann curvature tensor given in these two papers can be found in these lecture notes as well (see [p. 11]), but it is clear from entries on [p. 10] and [p. 25] and from Reichenbach's notes (the last part of the second notebook) that}. From the metric, Christoffel symbos, and Riemann tensor is flat.

After serving in World War I, Reichenbach attended Einstein's lectures on special and general relativity in Berlin. We posses three sets of Reichenbach;s notes (HR-028-01-04, HR-028-01-03, HR-028-01-01 all undated). The last set of notes seems to corresponds to the Einstein's lecture on spring term 1919 \citep{Einstein1919c}. {The notes taken by Reichenbach very similar to Einstein's own notes\footnote{Further information about Einstein as an academic teacher, see Vol. 3, the editorial note, "Einstein's Lecture Notes,"pp. 3-10, and for a survey of Einstein's academic courses, see Vol. 3, Appendix B.}. \cop{The first sections of the lectures follow the corresponding sections Einstein's previous published presentations \citepp{Einstein1916}{Einstein1914a}.} \cop{The general theory of relativity rests formally on the geometry of Riemann, which bases all its conceptions on that of the interval} 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:lineelement}
ds^2=\gmn dx_\mu dx_\nu\,.
\end{equation}
%
between points indefinitely near together, in accordance with the formula, these magnitudes $g_{\mu \nu}$ determine the behavior of \rac with reference to the coordinate system, as well as the gravitational field \citep[028-01-04, 46]{HR}. From the \gmn the so called Christoffel symbols \christoffel{\mu}{\nu}{\tau}, functions of the \gmn and their first derivatives, linear in the latter. which enter into the geodesic equation \citep[028-01-04, 46, 2ff]{HR}. It is possible to chose a coordinate system Christoffel symbols vanish everywhere, by the vanishing of Riemann tensor \rite, which is function of the Christoffel symbols and their first derivatives  After this standard presentation in both Reichenbach and Einstein's lecture notes show how Einstein also used for the first new interpretation of the curvature in terms of the parallel displacement given by Tullio \citet{Levi-Civita1916} and Hermann \citet{Weyl1918}, who are mentioned explicitly. It is useful to sketch the fundamental ideas in order as premise to the of the paper.



%\begin{equation*}
%\christoffel{\mu}{\nu}{\tau} = \frac{1}{2} g^{\tau \sigma}\left(\frac{\partial x_{\mu \sigma}}{\partial x_{\nu}}+\frac{\partial g_{\nu \sigma}}{\partial x_{\mu}}-\frac{\partial g_{\mu v}}{\partial x_{\sigma}}\right)
%\end{equation*}.

%The latter which enter in the of the geodesics equations, and thus when move on straight line. We know from special relativity that a free particle moves along a timelike geodesic in a non-accelerated coordinate system:
%
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:geodesicchristoffel}
%\frac{d^{2} x_{\tau}}{\dap^{2}} + \christoffel{\mu}{\nu}{\tau} \frac{d x_{\mu}}{\dap} \frac{dx_{\nu}}{\dap} = 0\,,
%\end{equation}
%%
%where $\ap$ is the affine parameter of the geodesic. In unaccelerated rectangular coordinates $K$, the second term vanishes of \cref{eq:geodesicchristoffel}, and the equations reduce to, which are the equations of a straight line. When we switch to other coordinates $K'$ un uniform acceleration with respect to $K$, the path is no longer straight, that is, it is no longer given by a linear relation between the coordinates and right-hand side of \cref{eq:geodesicchristoffel} does not vanish. Again since uniform acceleration from being at rest in a uniform gravitational field, the presence of gravitation is characterized by the non-vanishing of the Christoffel symbols. The necessary and sufficient condition that we can find a coordinate system which is everywhere inertial, is that 
%
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:riemanntensor}
%\riteg =-\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{\tau}}\christoffel{\mu}{\sigma}{\rho}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{\sigma}}\christoffel{\mu}{\tau}{\rho} - \\ \christoffel{\mu}{\sigma}{\alpha}\christoffel{\alpha}{\tau}{\rho}+\christoffel{\mu}{\tau}{\alpha} \christoffel{\alpha}{\sigma}{\rho}\,.
%\end{equation}
%%
%It is possible to chose a coordinate system Chirstoffel symbols vanish everywhere if the Riemann tensor vanish. 
%
%\begin{equation*}
%\riteg = 0
%\end{equation*}The key conceptual is that to have extended equations also in the case in which $\riteg \neq = 0$;


In Euclidean geomtry it is always possible to introduce a Cartesian coordinate system in which two vectors are equal and parallel when they have the same components. However, this relation does not hold if we introduce curvilinear coordinates, \eg polar coordinates \citep[028-01-03, 35]{HR}. The coefficient are different from point to point, $\vartheta$. Thus, vectors at different points can no longer be directly compared. If one displaces a vector to a neighboring point $dx_\nu$, one does not know whether the vector has remained the \scare{same}, that is equal and parallel to itself, by simply looking at its components. To reestablished  (\german{Zusammenhang}), one requires to introduce a rule for comparing vectors at infinitesimally separated points. Given a vector $A^\tau$ at \xn in an arbitrary coordinate system, we need to determine the components of the vector $A^{\prime\tau}$ at $\xn+d\xn$ that is to be considered the \scare{same vector} as the given vector $A^\tau$. The vector $A^{\tau}$ at the point $P\left(x^{\nu}\right)$ and the vector $A^{\tau}+d A^{\tau}$ at the point $P^{\prime}\left(x^{\nu}+d x^{\nu}\right)$ are the \scare{same vector}, if they satisfy the condition:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:affine}
dA^\tau = \Gamma^\tau_{\mu\nu}A^{\mu} dx_\nu\,.
\end{equation}
%
the  quantity $\Gamma^\tau_{\mu\nu}$ is known as the \scare{affine connection} or displacement\footnote{The affine geometry is the study of parallel lines. \citet{Weyl1918b}. However, because it is a relation of \scare{sameness} rather than parallelism that is relevant in this context, others prefer to speak of the operation of \scare{displacement} (\german{Verschiebung}), where the latter indicates the small coordinate difference $d\xn$ along which the vector is transferred}. It has three indices, \ie, entails $\tau$ possible combinations of $\mu \times \nu$ coefficients, which can vary arbitrarily from point to point. Because in general $\Gtmn \neq \Gtnm$, the \Gtmn has $n \times n^2$ coefficients. If a vector $A^\tau$ is given at the point $P$ with coordinates \xn, \cref{eq:affine} yields the unknown components of the vector $A^{\prime\tau}$ at $P'$ with coordinates $\xn+dx_\nu$.

Levi-Civita assumed affine connection is symmetric $\Gtmn=\Gtnm$, which assure that the manifold \scare{flat in its smallest parts}. The affine connection, however, the length and angles of vector the inner product\todo{?}. He further imposed that condition that, in arbitrary coordinate system, vectors have length

\begin{equation*}\label{eq:metric}
l^2 = \gmn A^\mu A^\nu\,,
\end{equation*}
%
which does not change under parallel transport. If $A^\tau$ is displacement-vector $dx_\nu$, then thus the \cref{eq:metric} include \cref{eq:linelement} as a special case. this process. Thus, one can parallel-transport the vector $dx^\nu$ from any point to some other point, its length does not change.

%Wie also die Charakterisierung eines Vektors in P durch ein System von Zahlen (seine Komponenten) von der Wahl eines Koordi- natensystems abhängt,

%Thus the implication is that the length if two $ds$ every line is comparable with any other line. If these two conditions are imposed, one finds that the coefficients of the the affine connection \Gtmn are precisely the three-index Christoffel symbols that are obtained from the metric:


%define the law of parallel displacement, that is, the affine structure or space. If we have a space of given metric, we find that the T's are determined by the g's. It is sufficient to stipulate the condition that the modulus of the vector not vary, natural thing since it involves a repeated Euclidean process; that is, we must write that A2 = gIA'A* is invariant, which gives the conditions that the I's must satisfy, and one finds that they are precisely the three-index Christoffel symbols. It is easy to see that Riemann's fundamental tensor can be obtained with the parallel displacement.

\begin{equation*}\label{eq:levicivita}
\Gtmn=-\christoffel{\mu}{\nu}{\tau} = \frac{1}{2} g^{\tau \sigma}\left(\frac{\partial x_{\mu \sigma}}{\partial x_{\nu}}+\frac{\partial g_{\nu \sigma}}{\partial x_{\mu}}-\frac{\partial g_{\mu v}}{\partial x_{\sigma}}\right)
\end{equation*}

With this notion includes the notion of a parallel displacement. alone, without the aid of a metric, we may construct geodesics in the following manner. Continuing this process $\xn+d\xn+d^{\prime} \xn+d^{\prime \prime} \xn \ldots$, we can parallel displace a vector from any given point to any other distant point. As the size of each displacement goes to zero, this broken line becomes a continuous curve. Thus curve starts from P with a well-defined direction. If we use a parameter $\ap$ to designate points along the curve $dx\nu$, then $dx_\nu/d\ap=u^\tau$ is a vector, which The vector $u^\tau$ indicates the direction of the curve $x_\nu(\ap)$ at each point if its components are proportional to the increments $dx_\nu$ along the curve. By parallel-displacing a vector $u^\tau$ indicating the direction of a curve $\xn(\ap)$ at any of its points, one can define a special class of curves, the straightest lines among two points By parallel trasportin the vector $d x^{\mu}(P) / d s$ displaced to a point $P^{\prime}$ are identical with those of the vector $d x^{\mu} / d s$ at $P^{\prime}$, it can be shown:

%Now we use a parameter to designate points along the curve. Let $s$ be chosen to transform as a scaler and to have an invariant value at $P$ and $P^{\prime} .$ Then $d x^{\mu} / d s$ is a vector. The condition for a geodesic is that the components of the vector $d x^{\mu}(P) / d s$ displaced to a point $P^{\prime}$ are identical with those of the vector $d x^{\mu} / d s$ at $P^{\prime}$ :

 
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:geodesicequation}
\frac{d {u^\tau}}{d\ap} = \Gtmn u^{\mu} u^\nu
\end{equation*}
%
It is interesting that we have obtained this equation without recourse to the notion metric With this construction of a geodesic, as the straigthest line, rather that the shortest line. If \ap is the so-called \scare{proper time}, $u^\tau$ as the velocity four-vector of a particle, and $\frac{d {u^\tau}}{d\ap}$ its acceleration. The length of this vector is per defintion $=1$\todo{proper time}. 

As Einstein had remarked on several occasions, equation \cref{eq:geodesicequation} the conceptual core of \tr. According to special relativity, a freely movable body not subjected to external forces moves in a straight line and uniformly with respect to an inertial coordinate system $K$, in which the $\Gtmn=0$. Then, if we introduce new space-time co-ordinates $K'$ uniformly accelerated with respect to $K$, the $\Gtmn\neq 0$ and the trajectory of the particle is not straight. According to the equivalence principle $K'$ is however indistinguishable from $K$ in a gravitational field. Thus the non-vanishing of \Gtmn can be interpreted as the presence of the gravitational field. The \Gtmn are the components of the gravitational field, and the \gmn its potentials. The fact that \Gtmn are not a tensor represented form Einstein the \emph{unification} of inertial and gravitation. The fact that they are \german{wesengleich}. The same motion on a geodesic can be interpreted as inertial motion for $\Gtmn=0$ or as motion under the influence of a gravitational field for $\Gtmn \neq 0$.

%Indeed, the same hough a particle moves on a geodesic both in the absence and in the presence and in absence of 

%He believed that even though a particle moves on a geodesic both in the absence and in the presence of a gravi- tational field, a coordinate system can be chosen such that the connection components Γνμσ vanish or appear, and thus a gravitational field appears or disappears given a certain choice of coordinates

The crucial assumption which gives physical content to the \scare{trick} is that the new field is nontrivial, that is, in which one ca cannot set $\Gtmn=0$ everywhere in a finite region by a simple coordinate transformation. The notion of parallel transport provides a criterion to determine if it is possible to construct a coordinate system, with the $\Gamma$'s are zero. If any vector $A^{\mu}$ transported parallel around any closed curve must return to its initial point will be the same vector:

$$
\oint \Gtmn \frac{d A^{\tau}}{d \ap} d \ap=0
$$

The notion idea captures of \scare{curvature}. A connection is curved, if one parallel displaces $A^\tau$ along different paths, one gets, in general, a different vector $A^{\prime \tau}$ at a distant point \citep[028-01-03, 37]{HR}. \cop{Thus, the notion of \scare{sameness} of vectors refers only to neighboring points and can not in general be extended by continuous transfer along curve, to world points finitely apart from one another} \cop{A more convenient criterion for flat space without involving integration uses the tensor}, is to construct the following tensor:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:riemanntensorgamma}
R_{\mu \nu \sigma}^{\tau}(\Gamma)=\frac{\partial \Gamma_{\mu \nu}^{\tau}}{\partial x^{\sigma}}-\frac{\partial \Gamma_{\mu \sigma}^{\tau}}{\partial x^{\nu}}+\Gamma_{\alpha \nu}^{\tau} \Gamma_{\mu \sigma}^{\alpha}-\Gamma_{\alpha \sigma}^{\tau} \Gamma_{\mu\sigma}^{\alpha}\,.	
\end{equation}
%
This tensor Riemann-Christofel tensor \riteg. Levi-Civita and Weyl have had that can be obtained from a geometrical consideration based solely on the law of the affine connection. The manner in which the \Gtmn are expressible in terms of the \gmn plays no role in the derivation. This tensor the basis, of the general theory. From it the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar. Finally the field equations can be derived by an action principle by setting the Lagrangian $ \sqrt{g}R$.

\subsection{Weyl Theory}

The Levi-Civita-Weyl approach has a key conceptual advantage. As Einstein will repeatedly point out, it showed that the central concept was the \scare{displacement field} and not the metric. However, the approach had another implication. If one starts with a symmetric metric \gmn the road is marked. The Christoffel symbols are, so to speak, the only possible destination. However, if one defines the displacement \Gtmn independently from the metric \gmn, the Riemannian connection the connection \cref{eg:levicivita} appears only as a special case that has been achieved by introducing a series of conditions\todo{citations}. These conditions are at first sight natural, but by no means necessary. In 1919 Weyl had included the presentation of this development in the new editions of \citetile{Weyl1919} \citep{Weyl1919}. Weyl conceded that the connection must be symmetric. However, as it is well-known, Weyl was bothered by asymmetry comparison of direction of vectors which is path-dependent could not be the comparison of length is not. \qt{in any case in a pure \scare{neargeometrical} drop inadmissible assumption of the possibility of \scare{comparison at distance}: only distances that are located at the same place are}{ohnehin in einer reinen ,,Nahegeometrio" unzulässige Annahme der Möglichkeit des „Fernvergleichs" fallen lassen: nur Strecken, die sich an der gleichen Stele befinden}, that is in vector at the same point in different direction \citep[102]{Weyl1919a}.

%zieht und sich anheischig macht, aus der Weltgeometrie nicht nur die Gravitations-, sondern auch die elektromagnetischen Erscheinungen abzuleiten. Steckt diese Theorie auch gegen wärtig noch in den Kinderschuhen,

\cop{In order to obtain a truly nearby geometry, Weyl introduced metric \scare{connection} or displacement that make the congruent transport (of length) just as path-dependent as parallel transport}. If a vector of length $l$ is displaced from $x_\nu$ to $x_\nu$, it will in general have a new length $l+dl$, so that $dl/l=\phin dx_\nu$. In this way, in addition to the \scare{metric tensor} \gmn, a \scare{metric vector} $\phin$ of the same importance is introduced. As consequence, Weyl obtained a  symmetric affine connection which is more general than \cref{eq:levicivita} \citep[112]{Weyl1919} is then expressed in terms of the metric tensor and a four vector $\varphi_{\mu}$:

\begin{equation*}\label{eq:weylaffine}
\Gtmn = - \christoffel{\mu}{\nu}{\tau} +\frac{1}{2} g_{\mu}^{\tau} x_{\nu}+\frac{1}{2} g_{v}^{\tau} x_{\mu}-\frac{1}{2} g_{\mu \nu} x_\tau
\end{equation*}
%
By pluggin \cref{eq:weylaffine} into \cref{eq:geodesicequation} on btains the geosic equations. \cop{This makes it possible to determine geodesic null lines. The property of geodesic lines. that they are also shortest lines, is dropped in Weyl's geometry, because- the concept of a curve length becomes ~eaningless here.} An equivalent of the Riemann tensor \riteg can be introduced that can be split invariantly into two parts:

$$\bar{R}_{\tau \mu \nu}^{\sigma}=R_{\tau \mu \nu}^{\sigma}-\frac{1}{2} \delta_{\tau}^{\sigma} F_{\mu \nu}$$
%
where \rite is the curvature tensor in Weyl's theory and $\rite$ is the curvature tensor of Riemannian geometry (i.e., the Riemann tensor) add $F\mn$ is related which is the curl of the \phin. Thus, Weyl connections posses two curvatures. The Riemannian direction curvature, responsible for the change of direction under transport around a closed loop. and the \scare{length curvature} for the change of length. 

%where 4\lambda (x)$ is an arbitrary function of the space-time coordinates. where 1(x) is an arbitrary function of the space-time coordinates. This transformation was interpreted as a change of scale or the measuring standard (which, according to this theory, should be chosen at each point of space-time), since ds'2 = \ ds?.


%\cop{Furthermore, because by definition it measures the nonintegrability of length---the amount that the metric changes under transport around a closed loop---its vanishing is then necessary and sufficient condition for the recovery of Riemannian geometry}.


%This assumption is equivalent to postulating the non-vanishing of the homothetic curvature and the conservation of elements a and b. Analytically, this assumption introduces gauge transformation in addition to coordinate transformations. The affine connection is then expressed in terms of the metric tensor and a four vector $\varphi_{\mu}$ tied to the gauge transformations. Thus, to determine the structure of the universe and the field equations, it is necessary to use the ensemble $\left(\mathrm{g}_{\mu \nu}, \varphi_{\mu}\right)$ and not simply $\mathrm{ds}^{2}$.

%where Pijk/ is anti-symmetric in the indices i and i j as well as k and l. Whereas the equations Fik = 0 characterize the absence of an electromagnetic field i.e. a space in which the transfer of magnitude is integrable, one sees from (13) that pi, 0 are the invariant conditions for the absence of a gravitational field i.e. jkl for the parallel transfer of directions to be integrable. Only in Euclidean space is there neither electromagnetism nor gravitation.

This geometrical setting could be used as the starting  The search for such theory usually implies different steps, of which Weyl had introduced a new presentation of the second edition of his texstbook:

\begin{itemize}
\item the first step is to the geometrical field-structure in this case the fundamental variables are \gmn and \phin. That the \gmn are identified with the potentials of the gravitational field because of a \emph{physical fact} the equivalence principles. The \phin could be identified with the potentials electromagnetic field  because of the \emph{mathematical fact} that the $F\mn$ is the curl of the \phin, like in the first two Maxwell equations. 

\item the second step is find the field equations, via the \scare{action principle}. \cop{One constructs a scalar quantity (the action) from the dynamical quantities \gmn and \phin then finds the conditions needed to restrict the scalar to an extremum (a maximum or minimum) with respect to variations in those dynamical quantities. The problem the right action and the right dynamical quantities to produce the desired equations}, that is to recover Einstein and Maxwell field equations.

\item The final step is the comparison with experiment; in particular to see, if in addition if they imply the existence of the electron and other unexplained atomic phenomena. \co{On the other hand the stable solutions of the equations for the "problem of matter". satisfying adequate regularity conditions should lead to a discrete set of solutions depending on some parameter 3. This expectation had a (formal) similarity to a set of "discrete eigenvalues" of an operator, although here the operator was not linear.} \todo{Weyl1919}
\end{itemize}

Point to construct a geometrization of gravitational phenomena, his new theory represented a unified geometrization of both gravitational and electromagnetic phenomena, which were, at that point, the only kind known\footnote{\q{We have realized that physics and geometry coincide with each other and that the world metrics is one, and even the only one, physical reality}}. \q{Untersuchung herausstellen, daß diese Unterscheidung zwischen Geometrie und Physik ein Irrtum ist, da die Physik gar nicht über die Geometrie} \citep{Weyl116}

%If charges are present at all, this constant cannot vanish. If, in addition, it is assumed to be positive, it follows automatically that the curvature of space is positive and that the universe is finite, so that it is unnecessary to. add a special A-term to the gravit~tional equations.

%\cop{As for the gravitational equations· themselves, finally, these are not identical with Einstein's equations, even in the absence of an electromagnetic field (r/>, = 0), as might have been expected from earlier arguments, and they are of higher order than the second.}


%However, the rethorical declaration the goal was far more complicated. 

%to utter contempt. He admired Weyl's theory "*as a chain of ideas" (Doc. 59), but as a theory of physical reality it was to him "fanciful nonsense" (Doc. 294).

\subsection{The Bad Nauheim meeting of September 1920}

%Im Nov. 1920 wollte ich einen populären Aufsatz über Rel. th. f. d. Umschau schreiben. I Ich kam auf den Gedanken,

Reichenbach met Weyl for the first time at the 86th Assembly of the \german{Versammlung der Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher und Ärzte} in Bad Nauheim in September 1920. In his talk \citet{Weyl1920a} introduced the distinction between \german{Einstellung} and \german{Beharrung} to explain away the discrepancy between the non-Riemannian behavior of the \scare{ideal} time-like vectors implied by his theory and the Riemannian behavior of the \scare{real} clocks that are actually observed. He suggested that atomic clocks might not \emph{preserve} their Bohr\todo{Laue} radius if transported, but \emph{adjust} it every time to some constant field quantity, which he could identify with the constant radius of the spherical curvature of every three-dimensional slice of the world, furnishing a natural unit of length. The fact that all atoms of the same type are exactly identical clearly cannot depend on an initial agreement established in the past, which has been \scare{preserved} since then, even though the atoms had encountered very different physical circumstances. It was more plausible to argue that they \scare{adjust} anew each time to a certain equilibrium value. Thus one might surmise that vectors behave in a non-Riemannian way, whereas atoms used as clocks, which are after all physical systems like any other, appear to have a Riemannian behavior.


%\footnoteh{He suggested that atomic clocks might not \emph{preserve} their Bohr radius if transported, but \emph{adjust} it every time to some constant field quantity. Weyl suggested that the atoms we use as clocks might not preserve their size if transported, but adjust it every time to some constant field quantity, which he could identify with the constant radius of the spherical curvature of every three-dimensional slice of the world, furnishing a natural unit of length. The geometry read off from the behavior of material bodies would appear different from the actual geometry of space-time, because of the \scare{distortion} due to the mechanism of the adjustment. Two identical \scare{classic} atomic systems with different prehistories would probably differ in some small detail due to their interaction with the environment, and their spectral lines would be slightly shifted, so that classically, a spiraling charge should emit light of all colors. Emerging quantum theory had already made clear that the spectral identity of atoms revealed by experience cannot be explained in this framework. The fact that all atoms of the same type are exactly identical clearly cannot depend on an initial agreement established in the past, which has been \scare{preserved} since then, even though the atoms had encountered very different physical circumstances. It was more plausible to argue that they \scare{adjust} anew each time to a certain equilibrium value}. 

%The size of an electron is determined by adjustment in proportion to the radius of curvature of the world, and not by persistence of anything in its past history. This is the view taken in § 66. and we have seen that it has great value in affording

In the discussion followed, commenting on Weyl's talk, Einstein reiterated his critiques. He pointed out once again that the \q{arrangement of \textins{his} conceptual system,} \q{it has become decisive \origins{massgebend} to bring elementary experiences into the language of signs \origins{Zeichensprache}} \citep[650]{Einstein1920c}. For Einstein, \q{temporal-spatial intervals are physically defined with the help of measuring rods and clocks}, under the assumption that \q{their equality is empirically independent of their prehistory} \citep[650]{Einstein1920c}. Einstein insisted that precisely upon this assumption rests \q{the possibility of coordinating \origins{zuzuordnen} a number $ds$ to two neighboring world points}; if this were impossible, general relativity would be robbed of \q{its most solid empirical support and possibilities of confirmation} \citep[650]{Einstein1920c}.

% The time or space intervals have a physical basis only if there is some actual or possible physical process that has a length or a duration shorter or equal to the space or time interval in question. A distance smaller than the electron would be physically meaningless since there is no physical process that could realize such an interval. The attempt to define the electromagnetic field or gravitational field in the interior of elementary particle to account for their stability should be rejected on epistemological grounds.


However, Einstein was immediately forced to open the possibility of a different stance by replying to a comment of Pauli's. The goal of Weyl theory was to construct a field theory of matter, in which the electron is a region of the field in which the field straight are enormously concentrated. However, the field strength in the interior of the electron is meaningless because there is no smaller test particle than the electron; \q{one could claim something similar concerning spatial measurements, \myemph{since there are no infinitely small measuring-rods}} \citep[650]{Einstein1920c}. If e.g. the theory claims that geometry of is non-Euclidean within elementary particle, there is no way to check this prediction just like we can check that the geometry around the sun is non-Euclidean. Einstein replied to Pauli that \q{with the increasing refinement of the system of scientific concepts, the manner and procedure of associating the concepts with experiences becomes increasingly more complicated} \citep[650]{Einstein1920c}. In particular, he recognized that in cases such as that of the continuum theories, \q{one finds that a definite experience cannot be associated any longer with a concept} \citep[650]{Einstein1920c}. According to Einstein, there the physicists is at a crossroads: one can abandon \scare{continuum theories} for the sake of Pauli's observability criterion, or replace such a \q{system of associating concepts \textins{with experiences} with a more complicated one} \citep[650]{Einstein1920c}. A decision as to which alternative is more suitable, Einstein pointed out, can only be given on the basis of pragmatic reasons \citep[650]{Einstein1920c}. Indeed, it would soon become clear that Einstein ultimately opted for the second choice.  One can already glimpse the main lines of Einstein's in his contributions to the the discussion which followed Max von \citets{Laue1920}'s Bad Nauheim paper on the gravitational redshift\footnote{Laue showed that the coordinate interval $d\vartheta$ measured by an atom on the sun is transmitted unchanged by light signals (at least in a static gravitational field\footnote{In the general case, the number of vibrations of an atom transmitted by light signals is coordinate dependent}), so that the redshift emerges by confronting the frequency of such signals with those of an atom of the same type at rest measuring the proper time $d\tau$}, in which Einstein did not hesitate to admit that \q{[it] is a logical shortcoming of the theory of relativity in its present form to be forced to introduce measuring rods and clocks \myemph{separately instead of being able to construct them as solutions to differential equations}} \citep[Einstein's reply to][662\me]{Laue1920}. Thus, Einstein now openly admitted that it would have been logically or epistemologically preferable if the field equations of the theory had suitable solutions corresponding to particles, from which in principle the stability of a more complicated, bulky configuration of matter could be reconstructed, including rod- and clock-like structures. In this way the necessity of coordinating the geometrical/kinematical structure of the theory separately from the rest in terms of rods-and-clocks behavior would fall and with it also Pauli's objection that such definition is impossible within elementary particles.

Thus Einstein vacillated between to different epistemological stances. On the one hand he considered that \textit{sub specie temporis}, thatthe  \q{invariant $ds$ is connected with observable facts [measured using rods and clocks], just like it happened to the fundamental concepts of Maxwell theories through Heinrich Hertz} \CPAE{??}{??}. However, he continued, he conceded that this empistemological models fails in the infisimaly small and in the finitesimaly large, where no such \rac might be at our disposale. Thus \emph{sub specie aeterni} \rac should do not play the part of irreducible elements, but that of composite [atomic] structures, that comes of out of the theory at the end. Thus, provisionally that geometry can be tested empirically separately from the rest of physics, indeed \gr seems to this the \gmn as measured with \rac with respect to a given corodiante syste, However, in the general case only geoemtry and physocs togehter. One would chose a certain geometrical strucutre, that leed to right field equaitons. The latter would have soltuons atomic struc, wthat would serve as rac.  geometry cannot be tested separately from ultimately only the theory as a whole $G+P$. 

Reichennach and most logical seems to have missed that adress Pauli's and Weyl's crossfire. It was also to open the possibility of his own \uftp, read the lecture simply of between geometry and physsics, whereas that this separation for the sake of \uftp. Indeed, in the following months Einstein will soon first unified field theory conformal. Weyl has accepted the existence of transportable \rac but denied that they preseved their lengths. That \q{mit WEYL auf die Voraussetzung 11, sondern auch auf die Voraussetzung H von der Existenz übertragbarer Maßstäbe (bzw. Uhren) von vornherein verzichtet. Im folgenden soll null gezeigt werden, daß}. In the new theory only the $ds=0$ has a physical meaning. This approach an important stepping stone to will soon abandon the very idea that the notion of parallel transport of vectors, which however have no physica meaning at all, to Reichenbach's dismay.

%That Weyl's theory has the pretence, but . Then was to renouce complelty as Einstien  sugested in March 1921, to avoid the use of \rac alltogeher.

Then the choicen becuase of its role in elementary particles, neither the could be defined in this way. The coordination a potential of a sever. Einstien will turned to the second method whe it will be conformatal. 

\label{Coordination}
After serving in World~War~\rom{1}, Reichenbach attended Einstein's lectures on special and general relativity in Berlin. We posses three sets of Reichenbachs of undated notes (HR-028-01-04, HR-028-01-03, HR-028-01-01). A set notes seems to corresponds are very similar to Einstein's own notes to the Einstein's lecture on spring term 1919 \citep{Einstein1919c}\footnote{Further information about Einstein as an academic teacher, see Vol. 3, the editorial note, "Einstein's Lecture Notes,"pp. 3-10, and for a survey of Einstein's academic courses, see Vol. 3, Appendix B.}. \cop{In the lectures follow the corresponding sections Einstein's previous published presentations  of \rt \citepp{Einstein1916}{Einstein1914a}.} However, both Reichenbach's and Einstein's lecture notes show in the 1919 lectures Einstein also used for the first time new interpretation of the curvature in terms of the parallel displacement introduced by Tullio \citet{Levi-Civita1916} and applied to \rt by Hermann \citet{Weyl1918}. Both names are mentioned explicitly. 

In the original presentation of \rt, Einstein started the metric $\gmn$ a coordinate indent criterion of the equality distance $ds$ of two nearby points  with coordinates $x_\nu$ and $x_\nu+dx_\nu$, the famous formula for the line element $ds^2=$. In the lectures, Einstein showed how one treat $dx_\nu$ as a special case of contravariant vector $A^\tau$. The so called affine connection $$dA^\tau = \Gtmn A^\mu dx_\nu$$ provides a coordinate-independent criterion for the parallelism of two vectors at neighboring points $x_\nu$ and $x+dx_\nu$ are equal and parallel. It can be show, that the notion of \scare{sameness} cannot be in general be extended to distant points by continuous transfer along curve. If one parallel displaces along different paths, one gets, in general, a different vector at a distant point \citep[028-01-03, 37]{HR}. In this way one could recover the notion of \scare{curvature} without any reference to the metric. The metric could be introduced at later stage by associating with any contravariant vector $A^\tau$ with a length $l^2=\gmn A^\mu A^\nu$. It was natural to assume that the length of vectors does not change under parallel transport. By imposing this condition Levi-Civita was able to recover the content Riemannian geometry. The line element $ds$ is nothing but the length $l$ of the contra-variant vector $dx^\nu$. 

Although not mention of this point is made in the notes, from discussions with Einstein, Reichenbach might have become immediately aware that \citep{Weyl1918a,Weyl1919a} was bothered by asymmetry comparison of direction of vectors which is path-dependent could not be the comparison their lengths was distant-geometrical. To overcome this \scare{mathematical injustice}, Weyl a introduced \scare{metric connection} alongside the \scare{affine connection}. If a vector of length $l$ is displaced from $x_\nu$ to $x_\nu+dx_\nu$, it will in general have a new length $l+dl$, so that $dl/l=\phin dx_\nu$. In this way, in addition to the \scare{metric tensor} \gmn, a \scare{metric vector} $\phin$ is introduced:

\begin{frame}{\secname}\setcounter{footnote}{0}
ds^2
\end{frame}

The \gmn are identified with the potentials of the gravitational field because of a \emph{physical fact} the equivalence principles. Weyl found natural to intepret \phin as the four-potential of electromagnetic field  because of the \emph{mathematical fact} that the tensor $F\mn$ is the curl of the \phin, and in turn constraint equivalent to Maxwell equations. Via the action principles from \gmn and \phin Weyl hoped was able to recover Maxwell and a set gravitational field equations. Weyl was initially confident  the stable solutions of the equations corresponding to elementary particles, allowing the ultimate comparison with experience.

Weyl could then conclude that just like general relativity represented a geometrization of gravitational phenomena, Weyl's theory represented a unified geometrization of both gravitational and electromagnetic phenomena, which were, at that time, the only kind known. Ultimately, matter itself would have become epiphenomenon of the \scare{world metrics}. With some rhetorical exaggeration, Weyl did not hesitate to declare \q{Der Traum des Descartes von einer rein geometrischen Physik} had be fulfilled. Concluding the 1919 edition of the book, Weyl could declare that \q{physics and geometry coincide with each other}. The tendency of physicalizing geometry that have prevailed leading protagonists of the 19th century from Gauss to Helmholtz seemed to superseded have of geometrizing physics that run from Riemann to Einstein: \q{geometry has not been physics but physics has become geometry} \citep[263]{Weyl1919}. 


%Ihre Gesetze werden ebensowenig in der Wirklichkeit jemals verletzt, wie es Wahrheiten gibt, die mit der Logik nicht im Einklang sind; aber über das inhaltlich-Wesen- hafte dieser Wirklichkeit machen sie nichts aus, der Grund der Wirklich- keit wird in ihnen nicht erfaßt

%ir hatten erkannt, daß Physik und Geometrie schließlich zusammenfallen, daß die Weltmetrik eine, ja viel- mehr die physikalische Realität ist. Aber letzten Endes erscheint so diese ganze physikalische Realität doch als eine bloße Form ; nicht die Geo- metrie ist zur Physik, sondern die Physik zur Geometrie geworden. Wir haben nicht mehr wie nach alter Anschauung einen leeren Raum als die Form, in deren Rahmen sich eine Materie von gediegener Wirklichkeit konstituiert, und als den Schauplatz, auf welchem sich die wirklichen Geschehnisse, das sind dieser Materie Veränderungen abspielen; sondern die gesamte physische Welt ist zur Form geworden, der aus ganz andern Bezirken als denen der Physis ihr Inhalt zuwächst. 

%In his eyes, physics seemed to be transformed to a purely formal status and was absorbed by geometry. Matter had seemingly become an epiphenomenon of the "world metrics" which started to acquire a slightly mystical flavour





%The great success which Einstein had attained with his geometrical interpretation of gravitation, led Weyl to believe that similar success might be obtained from a geometrical interpretation of electricity. Since the tensor of Riemannian space was already appropriated by gravitation, he constructed a wider geometrical frame which contained some unassigned geometrical elements which he could ascribe to electricity. 
%
%Before we \st{criticize} examine this idea, let us first review the actual achievements of the geometrical interpretation of gravitation. The field of force of gravitation affects the behavior of measuring instruments. Besides serving in their customary capacity of determining the geometry of space and time, they serve, therefore, also as indicators of the gravitational field. The geometrical interpretation of gravitation is consequently an expression of a real situation; namely, of the actual effect of gravitation on measuring rods and clocks.

%The geometrical interpretation of gravitation is merely the visual cloak in which the factual assertion is dressed. It would be a mistake to confuse the cloak with the body which it covers; rather, we may infer the shape of the body from the shape of the cloak which it wears. After all, only the body is the object of interest in physics. If we want to do the same for electricity, we must search for a similar physical fact which relates the electrical field to the behavior of measuring instruments, thus permitting a geometrical expression of the electrical field. However, the fundamental fact which would correspond to the principle of equivalence is lacking.



%Thus, Weyl's displacement space is not suited to describe the behavior of \rac and charged mass points in a combined electrical and gravitational field. \q{This means that we have found a cloak in which we can dress the new theory, but we do not have the body that this new cloak would fit} \rzlap{353}{493}. What alternatives do we have at our disposal? According to Reichenbach, physicists had tried to \q{forgo \textelp{} such a realization of the process of displacement} \rzlap{371}{519}.
%
%
%In Reichenbach's parlance, it is necessary to introduce a coordinative definition of the operation of displacement. Weyl's geometry is a balanced space, in which the comparison of lengths is defined, although not at a distance. Thus, it is natural to assume that the length of vectors can be measured with \rac. Weyl uses \rac as indicators of the gravitational field and, at the same time, indicators of the electromagnetic field.
%
%
%However, this was not conventional wisdom. \q{The great success, which Einstein had attained with his geometrical interpretation of gravitation, led Weyl to believe that similar success might be obtained from a geometrical interpretation of electricity} \rzlap{352}{491}. Just after \gr was accepted by the physics community, the search for a suitable geometrical cloak that could cover the naked body of the electromagnetic field began. To this end, one needed something analogous to the equivalence principle, a physical fact that relates the electrical field to the behavior of measuring instruments. \q{However, the fundamental fact which would correspond to the principle of equivalence is lacking} \rzlap{354}{493}. Thus, physicists had to proceed more speculatively.
%
%
%
%If reads the conclusion the long appendix has not been translated, but clearly the fundametal message of the book. That onserved into physicsc, but into geometry. The developed on the had ... ... So far, we have always that a simple physical realization must be given for the process of displacement. In our example we ourselves gave such a realization and we obtained, in this way, an actual geometrical interpretation of electricity. Attempts which were made by Weyl, Eddington and Einstein, on the other hand, renounced such a realization of the process of displacement. It is generally believed that such \scare{tangible} realizations does not lead to the desired field equations. 





%This was a battle on what was \gr and what was continue the key insight of general relativity. The argument was mean to counter who declared the \uftp as mislieading without the equivalence that garaneed between a connection with gravitationa field and \rac lighr rays, that is geometrical measuring instruments. 

%and the theory did not turn physics into geometry; Einstien to show that difference between geomery and rest of mathematics; the unificaiton program

%Objections against the very project of geometrization were raised my some at that time. Pauli e.g. has clearly a similar point to Reichenbach only graphical representations, however there was no motivation for geometrizing the electromangetic field wihout the equivalence principle. Einstein, in his willingels, that geometrization was not point. As we shall see for Einstein the point was the unification of the two fields. 


%\q{The general theory of relativity by no means turns physics into mathematics. Quite the opposite: it brings about the recognition of a physical problem of geometry} \q{development of the theory of relativity into a world geometry}. 

%The abstract of this presentation was published under the title \citetitle{Reichenbach1926d} \citep{Reichenbach1926d}. Thus, he concluded, providing a geometrical interpretation of a physical field is not in itself a physical achievement: \q{the geometrical interpretation is only a different parlance, which does not entail anything new physically}. \citep[25; my emphasis]{Reichenbach1926d}. As one can infer that at this point the pages were already in of developmen. The reason for the success is that theory had indeed effects on gravitational field, not that has been reduced to geometry. That the was uneceasry, there was not reason to pursue the proect. .That difference between geometry and physics, that on the very oppsite, the gola that there was non difference between geometry and the rest mathematics. Thus, could be further pursed, of unification and not of geometrya,







%The pages of this, that geometrization was but has an effect on geometry geometry is like cloak. The main goal. Geometry was different from physics, and maintial the difference. Indeed, that has effect on geometry, but it is not geometry. Einstein wanted to that geometry was not different from the rest of mathematics. The goal of introducing was to unify the two fields, into a single Lagrangian. Neither the of these variables was not essential, and only at the end after having integrated the field equations.

%eses, and since the theory of relativity has revealed the physical character of geometry as a science of real space, we can no longer doubt that these, too, are basically divisions of physics and that only the division of labor justifies the existing separation of specialties. We may, then, say that there are only


%Mathematics is the intellectual tool of physics; it teaches what is permissible and what is forbidden, but never what is physically co"ect.


%
%
%
%Reichenbach revealed that what he wanted to achieve was a geometrical interpretation of a physical field \scare{in \myemph{the same sense as gravitation}} in Einstein's theory, i.e., one that was \emph{just as good} as that attained by general relativity. The geometrical operation of displacement has a physical interpretation in Reichenbach's theory, just like the $ds$ does in general relativity Thus, Reichenbach claims to have provided not just a successful \scare{geometrical interpretation} of the electromagnetic field, but an interpretation that was of the same \scare{quality} as the one \gr provided for the gravitational field. However, this was Reichenbach's point: the theory was not a successful physical theory like general relativity. Thus, he concluded, providing a geometrical interpretation of a physical field is not in itself a physical achievement: \q{the geometrical interpretation is only a different parlance, which does not entail anything new physically}.

%that is gravitationa as efect on geometrical measureing insturmes \rac, light rays\etc, that could be isolated. On the opposite, to use geometrica withou, mathematical simplicity, itsefl Reichenbach hoped that his critical epistemological reflections could have served, so to speak, to tie physicists to the the mast of empiricism, so that they could resist to \q{the sirens' enchantment \origins{Sirenenzauber} of a unified field theory} \citep[373]{Reichenbach1928}.


%Some weeks later, in \datem{01}{12}{1927}, Reichenbach wrote to Einstein that Paul Hinneberg, the editor of the \citejournal{Einstein1928d} had told him that Einstein intended to write a review of his forthcoming book, \citetitle{Reichenbach1928}. Reichenbach sent him the galley proofs and also added that he would send an \Ap in the coming days \letteraeap{Einstein}{Reichenbach}{1}{12}{1927}[20-090]\todo{abs 295?}. Einstein's review appeared in the first 1928 issue of the \citejournal{Einstein1928d} \citep{Einstein1928d}. 




%The review was published in Spring 1928 in French \citep{Einstein1928b}. 



% Historical reasons aside, there was no real ground to define \gmn, the gravitational field, as a geometrical field, and, say, the \Fmn, the electromagnetic field, as a non-geometrical field. 



%Only its success can decide Its correctness, for it is purely a \emph{matter of experience}, whether the way to a simple and natural geometry also leads to an approximation to reality\footnote{Weyl in particular through his concept of \scare{Gauge-invariant}, has developed a method for narrowing the choice among the available equations. This is, indeed, a rigorously formulated principle which is more than a mere guide to to geometrical feeling. Whether this principle is correct is, of course, a purely empirical question}. It is noteworthy that contemporary discussions of these problems are filled with concepts like \scare{most natural assumption}, \scare{simplest invariant}, etc. ;


%However, the success of Einstein's geometrical interpretation of geometrical field was based, on somewhat expcetional circumstances:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \emph{Physically motivated} It was based the empirical fact of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass implies that free-fall is locally indistinguishable from inertial motion. The equivalence principle is the \emph{physical hypothesis} that this indistinguishability can be extended to all non-mechanical phenomena \rzlp{264}{229f.}. Because of the equivalence principle, gravitation is a \emph{universal force} that cannot be neutralized or shielded. Thus, there is no way to separate the geometrical measuring instruments that are not affected by the field (\rac, light rays, force-free particles) from the dynamical ones that react to the field (charged particles). Thus, the geometrical measuring instruments became at once indicators of the gravitational field.
%
%\item \emph{heuristically powerful} Such a geometrical interpretation accounts for old inconsistencies in Newton's theory concerning the irregularities of Mercury's orbit motion and allows for new predictions like a more pronounced deflection of light by the Sun. Measurements carried out with real physical systems, \rac, light rays, free-falling particles\etc, seem to have confirmed the theory's predictions. Thus, in the case of \gr, the \emph{geometrical interpretation} had indeed been instrumental in delivering new testable resulsts providing a smooth interpolation within a domain of observations. 
%\end{itemize}
%
%
%Neither of this circumstances were replicated in the previous theories. The geometrization was not physically motivated. As Reichenbach's it was ... however, it is not itself heuritically. The project of geometrizing the must should rehotu \q{The many ruins along this road urgently suggest that solutions should be sought in an entirely different direction}.   

%\qt{the degree of formal speculation, the slender empirical basis, the boldness in theoretical construction, and finally the fundamental reliance on the uniformity of the secrets of natural law and their accessibility to the speculative intellect}{spekulativ-formalistische Zug, die Schmalheit der Erfahrungsbasis[,] die Kühnheit der theoretischen Konstruktion, das ihr zugrunde liegende Vertrauen in die Einheitlichkeit und die Durchdringbarkeit der Geheimnisse der Naturgesetzlichkeit durch die spekulative Vernunft} \citep[114]{Einstein1930h}. This \q{speculative method}, Einstein claimed, was the same that lead to to success of \gr: \qt{Which are the simplest formal structures that can be attributed to a four-dimensional continuum, and which are the simplest laws that may be conceived to govern these structures?}{Welches sind die einfachsten und natürlichsten Bedingungen, welchen ein Kontinuum der skizzierten Art unterworfen werden kann? Die Beantwortung dieser Frage, welche ich in einer neuen Arbeit [7] versucht habe, liefert einheitliche Feldgesetze für Gravitation und Elektromagnetismus} \citep[115]{Einstein1930h}. In trying to defend this epistemological stance, Einstein was not afraid to side with \qt{Meyerson in his brilliant studies on the theory of knowledge}, who had emphasized the \scare{Hegelian} nature of such enterprise, \qt{without thereby implying the censure which a physicist would read into this}{geistreiche Erkenntnisstheoretiker Meyerson die geistige Einstellung der Relativitats-Theoretiker mit derjenigen Descartes und sogar Hegels verglichen ohne indes mit jenem Vergleich jenen Tadel zu verbinden, den das Ohr eines Physikers haturgemass heraushoren wird} \citep[115]{Einstein1930h}.

%By the time. Reichenbach has now abandoned his Kantianism, and to develop a form conventionalism to translate in a form of geometrical empiricism.  Reichenach that this separation was in the wrok as he have leard from personal conservations.

%Man darf eine Darstellung der relativistischen Philosophie nicht abschließen, ohne der wichtigen Erweiterung zu gedenken, die vor 3 Jahren Weyl dem Raumproblem zuteil werden ließ. Denn obgleich es sich hier zunächst um die Aufstellung einer mathemati- schen Theorie handelt, ist sie von ähnlicher philosophischer Bedeu- tung wie die Riemannsche Verallgemeinerung der euklidischen Geometrie, und darum unabhängig von aller Anwendung auf die Physik eine Erweiterung unseres philosophischen Wissens vom Raume. Die grosse Entdeckung Weyls besteht darin, daß er einen allgemeineren Mannigfaltigkeitstypus aufdeckte, von dem auch der Riemannsche Raum nur ein Spezialfall is

%The class (a) of Riemannian geometries is fixed by the axiom that lengths do not depend on their prehistory. \q{zwei natürliche Maßstäbe, die sich einmal zur Deckung bringen lassen, lassen sich auch nach dem Transport auf verschiedenen Wegen wieder zur Deckung bringen}. The (b) choice among geometries is ultimately conventional, that we consider rigid. The convention can be fixed by eliminating what we later will called forces of type $X$. After that the question whether is euclidean or not is empirical question, that can be answered by carefully by shielding from differential forces. Thus the sum, $G+P$ ultimately fixes the convention of (b). it may well also have Euclidean relations with the field $X = 0$, but this is a point which we can never know a priori. The merit of Weyl to have shown that the assumption (a) was not necessary. The first way to show it, in two ways Reichenbach seems to espouses that idea of the two versions of Weyl theory:



%It was however, most of all Einstein's \citetle{Einstein1921} became for Reichenbach of the separation between geometry and physics, and on the other hand to avoid the would. On the one hand, on the other he limti to the formula $G+P$.
%
% \cop{For instance, in a thermostatic universe with heterogeneous temperature, iron rods and copper rods form two distinct classes of approximately rigid rods}. The $G+P$ formula, offer avoid a completely arbitrary. The convention can be fixed by eliminating what we later will called forces of type $X$, that he will later call \scare{universal forces}. However, the of  class if coincidence can be obtained in one place between a pair of points of one rod and a pair of points of the other, this coincidence will be possible at any other place and time, no matter how their prehistory might be.

%Thus, Reichenbach insisted that there two different philosophical issues at stake that should not be confused:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Riemann, Helmholtz, and Poincar\'e introduced the problem of the \emph{coordinative definition} in the philosophy of geometry \rzlp{**}{257}. \Gr continued in this tradition. Once one defines $ds\pm =1$, $ds=0$ in terms of \rac and light rays, the geometry of \st can be ascertained empirically; it is a branch of physics that can be true or false.
%
%%Conceptual definition of $ds\pm =1$, $ds=0$ in integrated by by light rays, there is a coordinative definition that \rac.
%
%\item Einstein introduced the problem of a \emph{scientific explanation} of physical geometry, which finds its mathematical solution in the field equations \cref{eq:einsteinfieldequations}. The gravitational field has an effect on \rac and light rays, that is comparable to that of any other field of force, if not for the fact that it is a universal effect \rzlp{**}{256}.
%\end{itemize}

%The fact hat the \Ap has not been included in the final of the paper that a fundamental topic of the book. Was written in therms Riemann, Helmholtz, and Poincar\'e introduced the problem of the \emph{coordinative definition} in the philosophy of geometry \rzlp{**}{257}. \Gr continued in this tradition. Once one defines $ds\pm =1$, $ds=0$ in terms of \rac and light rays, the geometry of \st can be ascertained empirically; it is a branch of physics that can be true or false. Einstein introduced the problem of a \emph{scientific explanation} of physical geometry, which finds its mathematical solution in the field equations \cref{eq:einsteinfieldequations}. The gravitational field has an effect on \rac and light rays, that is comparable to that of any other field of force, if not for the fact that it is a universal effect \rzlp{**}{256}. 

%In this sense the has an effect on gemetry but it is not geometry, howeer that gravitaiona is  One starts for the coordinations, the fact that have a Riemannian behavior. One can start if one fails there are two different intepretaition. For a given temperature distribution over space, the metric depends on the kind of rod used, on different geometries Since there are other things which are not influenced in a similar manner to the little rods (or perhaps not at all) by the temperature of the table, in a thermostatic universe with heterogeneous temperature, iron rods and copper rods form two distinct classes of approximately rigid rods, different \emph{different geometries}. 

%As Reichenbach pointed out, according to \gr, the universal effect of gravitation on all kinds of measuring instruments defines a \emph{single geometry}, an, in general, non-flat Riemannian geometry. We do not speak of deformation of our measuring instruments \q{produced by the gravitational field}, but we regard \q{the measuring instruments as \scare{free from deforming forces} in spite of the gravitational effects} \rzlp{294}{256}.  \q{In this respect, we may say that gravitation is \oemph{geometrized}} \rzlp{294\oe}{256}. However this conclusion would be misleading. \q{It is not the theory of gravitation that becomes geometry, but it is geometry that becomes an expression of the gravitational field}. \cop{The field of force of gravitation affects the behavior of measuring instruments. 
%
%
%The reason of this success have been however misunderstood, however the reason of this success has been misunderstood, then they ahve confusde th clocka with that finding the cloak was the very was sufficient to reval it sehaps:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item As have seen, \q{The great success, which Einstein had attained with his geometrical interpretation of gravitation, led Weyl to believe that similar success might be obtained from a geometrical interpretation of electricity} \rzlap{352}{491}. If we want to do the same for electricity, we must search for a similar physical fact which relates the electrical field to the behavior of measuring instruments, thus permitting a geometrical expression of the electrical field \q{However, the fundamental fact which would correspond to the principle of equivalence is lacking}. Thus Weyl had to proced in more speculative. Following the analogy with relativity, it is natural to assume that the length of vectors can be measured with \rac. Weyl uses \rac as indicators of the gravitational field and, at the same time, indicators of the electromagnetic field. In the absence of the electromagnetic field, the \rac behave in a Riemannian way. Thus, \q{the Weylian space now constitutes the natural cloak for the field, which is composed of electricity and gravitation} \rzlap{354}{494}. However, however, it is precisely this behavior which does occur in reality \q{This means that we have found a cloak in which we can dress the new theory, but we do not have the body \hook{which} this new cloak would fit} 
%
%\item According to Reichenbach, physicists had tried follow, \q{Attempts which were made by Weyl, Eddington and Einstein, on the other hand, renounced such a realization of the process of displacement. It is generally believed that such \scare{tangible} realizations does not lead to the desired field equations. Consequently the problem of realization is left open for the time being}. This means that we have found a cloak in which we can dress the new theory, but we cannot even establish whether or not it would fit the body. That one uses the \Gtmn, \gmn or \phin etc. in order to find the right field equations. Indeed, \q{In this \scare{guessing} the geometrical interpretation of electricity is supposed to be the guide}. \q{with concepts like \scare{most natural assumption}, \scare{simplest invariant}, etc. ;}. The point of departure in this approach is \q{the (unwritten) assumption that whatever looks \emph{simple} and \emph{natural} from the viewpoint of the geometrical interpretation will lead to the desired changes in the equations of the field}.  It is this assumption which constitutes \q{the \emph{physical hypothesis} contained in these attempts}. \q{The geometrical interpretation of electricity can be carried through in any case, but it by no means follows that this added hypothesis must also be correct}.
%\end{itemize}
%
%Both strategies were motivated by a fundamental interpretational mistake. That the key of the success of \gr was the geometrization of the gravitational field, and thus that it was possible to replicate this success, by geometrizing the other field. If the proper geometrization was not sufficient, physicists was ready to use a mere graphical representation. That \gr was indeed a geometrical interpeation was by particular circumstances:  (a) \emph{Physically motivated}. Because of the equivalence principle, gravitation is a \emph{universal force} that cannot be neutralized or shielded, that uss all also the \rac became indicator of the gravitational field (b) \emph{heuristically powerful} Such a geometrical interpretation accounts for old inconsistencies in Newton's theory concerning the irregularities of Mercury's orbit motion and allows for new predictions like a more pronounced deflection of light by the Sun. Measurements carried out with real physical systems, \rac, light rays, free-falling particles\etc, seem to have confirmed the theory's predictions. 
%
%


%In the absence of the electromagnetic field, the \rac behave in a Riemannian way, that is the direction would haven under parallel transport. Thus, \q{the Weylian space now constitutes the natural cloak for the field, which is composed of electricity and gravitation} \rzlap{354}{494}. However, however, it is precisely this behavior which does occur in reality \q{This means that we have found a cloak in which we can dress the new theory, but we do not have the body \hook{which} this new cloak would fit}.

% It is this assumption which constitutes \q{the \emph{physical hypothesis} contained in these attempts}. 



%
% With the aid of this coordination, it is possible to interpret gravitational and electrical phenomena as expressions of the geometry of a Weylean space, so that electricity finds a geometrical interpretation \myemph{in the same sense as gravitation}.  The motion of charged particles under the influence of both the gravitational and the electromagnetic field deviate from the straightest lines, and takes the following form.  In the presence of charge, the \Gtmn is non-Riemannian, charged particles move on the straightest lines, and uncharged particles on the shortest lines. In the absence of charge, vanishes, and the connection reduces to that of Riemannian geometry. 





%
%Reichenbach praised Weyl's idea of defining the \Gtmn independently from the \gmn. However, he condemned Weyl's abandoned of the \cref{W2} in favor of the \cref{W1} strategy. For this reason, he proposed a theory in which on the \Gtmn have a physical meaning. The metric \gmn is measured not only by rigid rods but also by ideal clocks, which give physical meaning to the length of the four-dimensional vector $dx^\nu$. A similar coordinative definition should be provided for the displacement \Gtmn. Since we have to maintain the direction of a four-dimensional vector, 

Reichenbach suggested that one can tentatively adopt the velocity four-vector $u^\tau=d\xn/d\ap$ as the physical realization of the displacement \citep[\todo{page}]{Eddington1923} along a curve parametrized by the proper time $\ap$. By parallel-displacing a vector $u^\tau$ indicating the direction of a curve $\xn(\ap)$ at any of its points, one can define a special class of curves, the straightest lines. When the particle is not accelerating that is maintain the same velocity, the direction of the velocity vector does not vary. Thus, the motion of force-free particles can be used to define physically the straightest line between two \spti points. The motion of charged particles under the influence of both the gravitational and the electromagnetic field deviate from the straightest lines, and takes the following form:
%
%\begin{equation*}\label{eq:forceequation}
%\frac{d {u^\tau}}{d\ap} - \notateol{\Gtmn}{2}{\texts{Levi-Civita connection}} u^{\mu} u^\nu = \notateur{\frac{\rho}{\mu} f_{\tau}^{\mu} u^\tau}{2}{\texts{force term}}
%\end{equation*}
%%
%since the gravitational charge is the same to all particles, the mass coupling factor can be eliminated from the geodesic equation\todo{check}. Planets describe a trajectory which itself is assigned because it is attracted by the force of the sun, but we say: the planet moves along the straightest line defined by the \Gtmn. The force term indicates that the force experienced by charged particles is directly proportional to the charge and inversely proportional to the mass. Thus gravitation appears to be geometrized, but  electromagnetism does not. In order to geometrize the latter as well one might tentatively try to absorb the force term into the definition of the affine connection, and thus transform force equation a geodesic equations. To this purpose Reichenbach introduced a non-symmetric affine connection which we label \Gtmnbar. He imposed the in which however the lengths of vectors $l^2 \gmn dx^\nu dx^\nu$  does not change under parallel transport. Indeed, the velocity vector of particles is per definition always equal $1$ and only the change in direction indicates the change of velocity. A non-symmetric connection connection is always the sum of a symmetric connection and a non-symmetric three rank tensor with two lower indexes. With some change in notation, Reichenbach's definition of the connection is the following:
%
%  
%\begin{equation*}\label{eq:reichenbachconnection}
%\Gtmnbar = \notateor{\Gtmn}{2}{\texts{Levi-Civita connection}} + \notateul{\frac{\rho}{\mu} f_{\tau}^{\mu} u^\tau}{2}{\texts{skew-symmetric tensor}}
%\end{equation*}
%
%Put in this form one can see by simple inspection the force term of the geodesic equation has been introduced in the definition of the of the tensorial part of the affine connection. By substituting \Gtmnbar into \cref{force equation} one can turn the force equation into a geodesic equations of the same physical content. In Riemannian geometry the straightest lines are identical with the shortest lines. It his characteristic of a non-Riemannian connection, that the straightest lines do not generally coincide with its geodesics, that is with the shortest lines. In the presence of charge, from every point, in every direction, an auto-parallel and a geodesic emerge, which generally diverge. This divergence is a sign of the presence of charge\todo{better}.





%Weyl had immediately suggested a generalization of this theory in which  Between 1918 and 1919, Einstein criticized Weyl's theory repeatedly. The most famous but by no means only objection, regarded the physical interpretion of this geometrical apparatus\todo{better}. The length $ds$ of the time-like displacement vector $dx_\nu$ is measured atomic clocks; thus, Weyl theory should have predicted that the rate of ticking of atomic clocks should depend on the electromagnetic field \phin\todo{better}they have been through in the past. However, atomic spectroscopic overwhelmingly show that spectral lines of atoms are well-defined. In general, Einstein was rather cautious about the possibility of a unification project that he considered too speculative. In 1919 he submitted a paper in which who gravitational field could play structure of the electron of a modification of the original gravitational field equations of general relativity \citep{Einstein1919d}\todo{better}. However, there was initially no attempt to pursue a full fledged unification of the two fields. In spring 1919, however, Einstein seems to have reoriented his views probably after a correspondence with Theodore Kaluza, who suggested a \uft based on Riemannian geometry with five dimensions \citep{Wuensch2005}. Einstein ultimately decided not publish Kaluza's paper, however his attitude seems to have progressively acquired more interest in the unification project.



%There remains the peculiarity that the defined side does not carry its justification within itself ; its structure is determined from outside. Although there is a coordination to undefined elements, it is restricted, not arbitrary. This restriction is called "the determination of knowledge by experience." We notice the strange fact that it is the defined side that determines the individual things of the undefined side, and that, vice versa, it is the undefined side that prescribes the order of the defined side. The existence of reality is expressed in this mutuality of coordination.

%trikingly this idea of the mutuality of coordinating principles is presented in a very straightforward way in Reichenbach (1920). Here Reichenbach describes how the mathematical framework of a theory (the “defined side”) is related to empirical reality (the “undefined side”) :

%Reichenbach abandoned his \scare{Kantinanism} but will remain faithful to this line of criticism in the following years. \cop{In this work, which deals with the possibility of reconciling Einstein's theory with the Kantian system, the notion of constitutive a priori appears to be tied to a view of the cognitive coordination (Zuordnung) that can be traced back to the influence of Moritz Schlick's General Theory of Knowledge (1918/1974)}. According  \cop{knowledge, according to Reichenbach (1920, chapter 4), 

%While a priori in the constitutive sense, the coordination principles are contingent, process of a construction of a representation is hidden behind the idea of \scare{coordination}. \todo{??}. T
%The novelty is that Reichenbach (1920, chapter 6) also insists on the need for a special class of physical principles-"coordinating principles" or "axioms of coordination" to insure that this correspondence is uniquely well defined. For further discussion see again Friedman (2005).}. The separation was the an essential part of the book. And it is precisely in this context that Weyl cites Weyl theory as a counter example.



%As suggested several times above, however, I now think that my earlier presentations were too closely tied to the problem, first formulated by Reichenbach and Schlick, of establishing a "coordination" (Zuordnung) between abstract mathematical structures and concrete empirical phenom- ena.276 

%The difficulty arises when one accepts the sharp distinction, emphasized by Schlick, between an uninterpreted axiomatic system and intuitive perceptible experience, and one then views the constitutive principles in question (which, following Reichenbach, I called "coordinating principles" or "axioms of coordination") as characterizing an abstract function or mapping associating the former with the latter. This picture is


%Reichenbach \scare{axioms of connection} expressing express the connection between the specific physical magnitudes and \scare{axioms of coordination} that the rules to give particular values to those mangitudes.


%\cop{The \emph{axioms of connection} are the empirical laws of physics, the fundamental equations of a theory. The \emph{axioms of coordination} determine the rules of the application of the axioms of connection to reality, that is, they determine the rules of the connection.



%The specific laws can be combined into a deductive system so that all of them appear as consequences of a few fundamental equations. We will call these equations axioms of connection because they express the connection between the specific physical magnitudes. Opposite to these are the axioms of coordination, which represent the properties of all bodies, reduced to a minimum of propositions. An example of coordinating axioms of old physics are the axioms of geometry; Maxwell's equations are an example of connecting axioms.41 (HR 026-03-01, 56 bis)


%\cop{presented in a very straightforward way in Reichenbach (1920). Here Reichenbach describes how the mathematical framework of a theory (the "defined side") is related to empirical reality (the "undefined side") :} he \cop{“defined side” is the mathematical theory, and the “undefined side” represents the elements of reality. Yet the same idea is already presented }. 

%However, we will consider Reichenbach's early work only in as much as it includes his first critique to the \uftp.

%E.g. he mentions \q{neuen Einsteinschen Auffansung} in which  \q{bei der innerhbalb des Elcktroms wicder die nicht-Euklid. Geometric gilt} \citep[028-01-04, Randbemerkung zu Blatt 18]{HR}\todo{check}.  In particular, Reichenbach had probably become aware of Weyl's attempt to a geometrization of the electormagnetic field alongside with the gravitational field. Moreover, he seemed to have been aware of Einstein's early work on the topic. 

%As long as there was no non-Euclidean geometry, there was only one model of space for mathematics and physics alike. It seemed, therefore, that physics could simply take over from mathematics the concept of space and its laws, while mathematics, in turn, had the task of examining these laws by means of its own methods, thought to be inde- pendent of all experience. 

%Indeed, it is normal that \cop{formal structures could describe physical structures only by way of a certain approximation}.  


%reviously unseen connections. Consequently, Reichenbach considers the axioms connection as empirical laws in the usual sense, involving already sufficiently well efined concepts. Yet, as we have seen, the concepts in such equations require further ualification, viz., the assertion that they are valid for reality. It is only through the xioms of coordination that how these concepts can de facto apply to reality can be hown. And that is precisely their role: providing a "physical" definition of the conepts occurring within the axioms of connection. In that sense, the former determine meaning of the latter and they are therefore constitutive of the concept of the physcal object. Thus, the axioms of coordination determine the rules of the application of he axioms of connection to reality, that is, they determine the rules of the connection.


%The case of geometry \cop{{It is important to notice in this context the difference between physics and mathematics. Mathematics is indifferent with regard to the applicability of its theorems to physical things, and its axioms contain merely a system of rules according to which its concepts can be related to each other. A purely mathematical axiomatization never leads to principles of an empirical theory. Therefore, the axioms of geometry could not assert anything about the epistemological problem of physical space. Only a physical theory could answer the question of the validity of Euclidean space and discover at the same time the epistemological principles holding for the space of physical objects.}.

%Riemann, Helmholtz, and Poincar\'e introduced the problem of the \emph{coordinative definition} in the philosophy of geometry \rzlp{**}{257}, having shown definitions to be necessary at certain points where, earlier, scientists sought for facts, like examples are the congruence of distant spatial segments. We assume a fact that these rods are Riemannian. If we assemble \cop{twelve identical rods  into a hexagonal pattern with 6 rods joining at the center. If this assembly is carried out in a suitable gravitational field, the 6 rods no longer join at the center}. There are at least two geometrical explanations for this result. (a) The rods are rigid and the geometry is non-Euclidean. (b) The rods are deformed by a force and the geometry is non-Euclidean. 
%
%Forces are \emph{differential} they have different effect on different materials. For a given temperature distribution over space, the metric depends on the kind of rod used,  iron rods and copper rods form two distinct classes of approximately rigid rods, different different geometries. However, we could also imagine a universal force demonstrate that this force has the same effect upon everything (a) and (b) are equivalent descriptions In this case, however, geometrical claims like the earth is a sphere, will be empty. However, if one stipulates that are exluded the question of the geometry of space is completely determined and there of which rods are rigid. To avoid that is true intslef and convetion, and sophustatie geometrical empiricism.
%
%
%Deviation from Euclidean geometry, then the preceding argument means cab be always interpret interpret this deviation as action of a force that deforms the measuring rods. But to admit the existence of such universal forces in physics would be to introduce uncertainty into all practical measurements. 
%\paragraph{coordination}
%Einstein was to realized that because of the equivalence principle, gravitation is a \emph{universal force} that cannot be neutralized or shielded. Thus, there is no way to separate the geometrical measuring instruments that are not affected by the field (\rac, light rays, force-free particles) from the dynamical ones that react to the field (charged particles). Thus, we do not speak of the deformation of our measuring instruments \q{produced by the gravitational field}, but we regard \q{the measuring instruments as \scare{free from deforming forces} in spite of the gravitational effects} \rzlp{294}{256}. Once one defines $ds\pm =1$, $ds=0$ in terms of \rac and light rays, the geometry of \st can be ascertained empirically; it is a branch of physics that can be true or false. Indeed, the \gmn can measured with respect to a certain coordinate system under the assumptions that $ds$ has the same value in the every orientation and in every position. In turn the \gmn are the potentials of the gravitational field
%
%
%Einstein introduced the problem of a \emph{scientific explanation} of physical geometry, which finds its mathematical solution in the field equations \cref{eq:einsteinfieldequations}. The gravitational field has an effect on \rac and light rays, that is comparable to that of any other field of force, if not for the fact that it is a universal effect \rzlp{**}{256}.
%
%\paragraph{geometrizaion}
%
%However, Reichenbach wants to disabused the readers for taking this conclusion.   The presence revealed by, and not defined by the geometry, it is revealed by their behavior of geometrical measuring instruments. Besides serving in their usual capacity of determining the geometry of space and time, they serve, therefore, also as indicators of the gravitational field. The geometrical interpretation of gravitation is consequently an expression of a real situation, the \emph{universal coupling} of gravitation and matter. Measuring instruments made of whatever fields and particles can be used to explore the gravitational field, and the result of such measurements is independent of the device. In principle this physical fact should be explained by a feature theory \q{It is not the theory of gravitation that becomes geometry, but it is geometry that becomes an expression of the gravitational field}.

%It gives an idea of Reichenbach's intentions what he wrote to Einstein (June 15, 1920) when asking permission to dedicate him his book Relativitätstheorie und Erkenntnis Aprior®: "You know that with this work my intention was to frame the philosophical consequences of your theory and to expose what great discoveries your physical theory have brought to epistemology. I know very well that very few among tenured philosophers have the faintest idea that your theory is a philosophical feat and that your physical conceptions contain more philosophy than all the multivolume works by the epigones of the great Kant. Do, therefore, please allow me to express these thanks to you with this attempt to free the profound insights of Kantian philosophy from its contemporary trappings and to combine it with your discoveries within a single system." To this letter, Einstein replied (June 30, 1920)4: "The value of the th. of rel. for philosophy seems to me to be that it exposed the dubiousness of certain concepts that even in philosophy were recognized as small change. Concepts are simply empty when they stop being firmly linked to experience."

%\footnote{It might be indeed argued that this is true for previous theories. However, Reichenbach seems to share \citet[84]{Eddington1923}'s analysis that most of those theories were primarily \scare{graphical representations} of the relations between certain quantities \citep[\S15 and \S50]{Reichenbach1928a}. \citet[281]{Eddington1929} considered Einstein's \FP-field theory as a mere graphical representation: the graph of a moving particle with time and space as coordinates is no better than one using velocity and curvature as coordinates. However, Reichenbach seems to considered it as the a proper non-geometrical unification. See also \cite[121f.]{Goldstein2003}}


%The only way out, was 


%In general physical systems that one uses as measuring instruments cannot does not lead an independent existence alongside of the objects implicated by the field-equations \citep[686]{Einstein1949a}. In this situation the context the choice of particular field structure (the basic variables and their transformation properties) could not be defined operationally. One has to search them, and the to find the right field equations. The principle of general covariance limits, but does not determine the field-equations uniquely. The principle of \scare{logical simplicity} as a criterion for the choice of the right set of equations \citep[120]{Einstein1950e}. \q{What most simple property can be required from what most simple object (field) while pre­ serving the principle of general relativi­ty?} \citep[15]{Einstein1950}. 

%In this view what general relativity really succeeded in doing was to eliminate geometry from physics

%In popular paper written at about the same time, Einstein described himself as a \emph{tamed metaphysician}  \citep[13]{Einstein1950c} that mathematical simplicity as a key to physical reality, which existen independently of the subject.

%As is well known, Einstein raised this precise objection against Reichenbach in the so-called \enquote{Reply to Criticisms} of the Schilpp-Volume \citep{Einstein1949a}. At the end of a fictional dialogue between Reichenbach and Poincar\'{e} \citep[677--678]{Einstein1949a}, Einstein entrusted his epistemological views to the persona of an \emph{anonymous non-positivist} (or, as he put it elsewhere, a \scare{tamed metaphysician}; \cite[3]{Einstein1950}): a theory has a \scare{meaning}, a physical content, only as a whole, even if its parts, in isolation, do not find a direct physical interpretation \citep[678]{Einstein1949a}

Replying to Reichenbach paper Einstein described himself as \scare{non-positivist}, that only  geometry cannot separately from the rest physics, Einstein did not that the coordination of the geometrical with reality was the necessary of theory. Thus, no real definition of such quantities seems to be possible: \q{To really understand my point of view you must read my answer in the \textins{Schilpp}-volume \textins{Sammelband}} (\letter{Einstein}{Besso}{15}{4}{1950}[438--439][Einstein1972]).  Neverhtesl \q{Don Quixotian situation} in which one finds oneself in the search for a unified, non-dualistic, field theory. 



%When in 1953 Schilpp asked Einstein for contributing to the volume of the same series in honor of Carnap \letteraeap{Schilpp}{Einstein}{11}{5}{1953}[80-539], he famously declined. After \q{Reichenbach's death (a few weeks ago),}\footnote{Reichenbach died on \datef{9}{4}{1953}} Schilpp wrote, Carnap was the most important exponent of logical empiricism \letteraeap{Schilpp}{Einstein}{11}{5}{1953}[42-534]. Although Einstein agreed with this assessment, he expressed disenchantment toward that type of philosophy that Schlick, Reichenbach, and Carnap represented: \q{the old positivistic horse, which originally appeared so fresh and frisky, has become a pitiful skeleton} (\letteraea{Einstein}{Schlipp}{19}{5}{1953}[42-534]; quot.\ and tr.\ in \cite[374]{Howard1990}).

%Wenn wir zu Anfang dieses Kapitels mit Einstein die Maßbestimmung im Äther mit Hilfe von Maßstäben und Uhren definierten, so kann man das nur als eine vorläufige Anknüpfung an die Erfahrung gelten lassen, wie etwa auch die Definition der elektrischen Feldstärke als ponderomoto- rische Kraft auf die Einheitsladung. Es ist nötig, den Kreis zu schließen; nachdem einmal die physikalischen Wirkungsgesetze aufgestellt sind, muß man bewez"sen, daß hier die geladenen Körper unter dem Einfluß des elektromagnetischen Feldes, dort die Maßstäbe unter dem Einfluß des me- trischen Feldes zufolge der Wirkungsgesetze jenes Verhalten zeigen, das wir anfänglich zur physikalischen Definition der Feldgrößen benutzt haben. Es ist heute sicher, daß wir dazu der Ansätze der Quantentheorie be- dürfen. Die Bohrsehe Atomtheorie 39) zeigt, daß die Radien der Kreis- bahnen, welche die Elektronen im Atom beschreiben und die Frequenzen d e s a u s g e s e n d e t e n L i c h t s s i c h u n t e r B e r ü c k s i c h t i g u n g d e r Kon~titution des Atoms bestimmen aus dem Planckschen Wirkungsquantum, aus La- dung und Masse von Elektron und Atomkern. Ähnlich wie mit jenen Radien wird es sich mit den Gitterabständen in einem kristallinischen Medium verhalten und infolgedessen auch mit der Länge eines gegebenen starren Maßstabs. Die neueste Entwicklung der Atomphysik hat es wahr- scheinlich gemacht, daß die Urbestandteile aller Materie das Elektron und der Wasserstoffkern sind; alle Elektronen haben die gleiche Ladung und Masse, ebenso alle Wasserstoffkerne. Daraus geht mit aller Evidenz her- vor, daß sich dz"e Ato?nmassm, Uhrperioden und Maßstablängen 11icht durclt irgendeine Beharrungstendenz erhaltm; sondern es handelt sich da um einen durch die Konstitution des Gebildes bestimmten Gleichgewichts- zustand, auf den es sich sozusagen in jedem Augenblick neu einstellt. Das erklärt die folgende grundlegende Tatsache, von der wir bei der De- finition des metrischen Feldes ausgingen (ich spreche sie, statt für die geometrischen Radien der Atombahnen, lieber für die Atommassen aus, die offenbar etwas physikalisch Ursprünglicheres sind): Ein Wasserstoff- und ein Sauerstoffatom mögen jetzt, wo sie sich nebeneinander an der gleichen Feldstelle P befinden, ein bestimmtes Massenverhältnis I 1oo8: 161ooo be- sitzen; sie bewegen sich getrennt voneinander während langer Zeit in der Welt und treffen in einem viel späteren Weltpunkte P von neuem zu- sammen; wir finden daselbst genau das gleiche Massenverhältnis wie z"n P. Dies Massenverhältnis stellt sich nicht in P ein, weil es in P geherrscht hatte, sondern weil es durch die Konstitution des Wasserstoff- und des Sauer- stoffatoms erzwungen ist. Die Wiederkehr des gleichen Massenverhältnisses muß also darauf beruhen, daß sich jede Atommasse einzeln auf ein be- stimmtes Verhältnis einstellt zu dem an der betr. Feldstelle herrschenden Wert einer gewissen Feldgröße, welche die Dimension einer Länge (=Masse) besitzt.

%Noting the very special nature of Weyl's generalization, Eddington started Dy assuming that there was no a priori connection between the metric and an initially arbitrary symmetric connection. He observed that the curvature or Riemann tensor from the affine connection without any metric. This Ricci tensor, however, will in general not be symmetric, even though the connection is. What has this to do with physics? Eddington noted that an affine connection enables us to compare tensors at neighboring points (in particular, to say when two neighboring vectors are parallel). He regarded the possibility of such a comparison between quantities at neighboring points in space-time as the minimum element necessary to do any physics: "For if there were no comparability of relations, even the most closely adjacent, the continuum would be divested of even the rudiments of structure and nothing in nature could resemble anything else."27


%According to Einstein \q{Begriff de Parallelverschiebung entstammt wie alle Begriffe der euklidischen Geometrie der Betrachtung der Lagerungs-Gesetze bezw. der Gesetze der relativen Verschiebung starrer Körper.

%In the summer of 1923, Einstein continued to regard the affine approach as promising. In July, Einstein went to Sweden to receive the Nobel Prize. He did not give the traditional Nobel address, in which \q{we cannot rely on experimental facts as in the construction of the theory of grnvitation (equality of the inertial and grnvitational masses) but are forced to restrict ourselves to the criterion of mathematical simplicity, which is not free of arbitrariness.}. \cop{Finding the simplest differential equations that the affine connection can satisfy, we are justified in hoping that we shall find a generalization of the equation of gravitation that will also contain the Jaws of the electromagnetic field.... This hope was indeed justified, but we do not know if the formal connection obtained in this manner can be regarded as a real enrichment of physics as long as no new physical connections have been obtained. In particular, a field theory can be recognized as satisfactory, in my opinion, only when it pennits the description of elementary electric particles by means of solutions that do not contain singularities.

%Recent attempts to geometrize the electromagnetic field seemed to have implmented now implemented Weyl's second strategy. One starts to find a suitable geometrical structure the \gmn and $\phi_\mu$, as in Weyl geometry, symmetric \Gtmn in Eddington's theory\etc, non-symmetric \gmn and \Gtmn in Einstein's metric-affine theory\etc. Those variables have adimittedly no physical meaning and there is no attempt to provide their physical interpretation, but are only tools to find the field Langrangian. Reichenbach claims that those theories are only \scare{graphical representations} (\german{graphische Darstellungen})---an expression he evidently borrowed from \citet[294ff.]{Eddington1925a}. \cop{The theory helps just like a graph provide useful economical device to organize physical already known knowledge}. Reichenbach adopted a different strategy, by attempting to get back to Weyl's original approach. Einstein's theory had given to the \gmn a physical meaning from the outset. Recent attempts to geometrize the electromagnetic field seemed to have implemented now implemented Weyl's second strategy, affine connection \Gtmn and to not give any physical meaning of displacement.
