In Schouten 1922 he consider by he improved he classification trhee tensor 27 possible connection.

I think that this hybrid definition of length is undesirable,}. 




One can think of $d\xn$ as the components of a (contravariant) vector $A^\tau$, $n$ numbers $A^\mu$ ($A^1, A^2, A^3, A^4) that we associate with some point $P$ and transform as per certain rules by the change of coordinates. In Euclidean geometry, it is always possible to introduce a Cartesian coordinate system in which two vectors are equal and parallel when they have the same components. However, this relation does not hold if we introduce curvilinear coordinates, \eg polar coordinates. Although parallel vectors are still parallel in the new coordinate system, the equality of the components of two parallel vectors attached to two different points in space is not preserved. \Eg consider two unit vectors $A^\tau$  and $A^{*\tau}$ on a plane pointing along the $x$ direction: one at the point at $(0,1)$ and another at $(1,0)$ in Cartesian coordinates. In this coordinate system, $A^\tau$  and $A^{*\tau}$ have the same components, \ie they are equal and parallel. However, in polar coordinates $r,\vartheta$ (where $r$ represents distance from the origin, and $\vartheta$ represents the angle that the point makes with the origin and the positive $x$-axis), $A^\tau$ has only a $r$ component, whereas $A^{*\tau}$ has only a $\vartheta$ component. Nevertheless, they are still equal and parallel. Indeed, the vector $A^*\tau$ can be obtained by displacing $A^\tau$ parallel to itself along a circle. In polar coordinates, the components $A^\tau$ change at each point even though its length and direction remain the same

In Euclidean geometry, it is always possible to introduce a Cartesian coordinate system in which two vectors are equal and parallel when they have the same components. However, this relation does not hold if we introduce curvilinear coordinates, \eg polar coordinates. Consequently, vectors at different points can no longer be directly compared. If one displaces a vector to a neighboring point $dx_\nu$, one does not know whether the vector has remained the \scare{same} by simply examining its components. The \scare{connection} (\german{Zusammenhang}) from a point to another is lost. Because the affine geometry is the study of parallel lines, \citet{Weyl1918b} used to speak of the necessity of establishing an \scare{affine connection} (\german{affiner Zusammenhang}). However, because it is a relation of \scare{sameness} rather than parallelism that is relevant in this context, others, such as Reichenbach, prefer to speak of the operation of \scare{displacement} (\german{Verschiebung}), where the latter indicates the small coordinate difference $d\xn$ along which the vector is transferred. 


To reinstate the \scare{connection} one requires to introduce a rule for comparing vectors at infinitesimally separated points. Given a vector $A^\tau$ at \xn in an arbitrary coordinate system, we need to determine the components of the vector $A^{\ast\tau}$ at $\xn+d\xn$ that is to be considered the \scare{same vector} as the given vector $A^\tau$. The vector $A^{\tau}$ at the point $P\left(x^{\nu}\right)$ and the vector $A^{\tau}+d A^{\tau}$ at the point $P^{\ast}\left(x^{\nu}+d x^{\nu}\right)$ are the \scare{same vector}, if they satisfy the condition:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:affine}
dA^\tau = \Gamma^\tau_{\mu\nu}A^{\mu} dx_\nu\,.
\end{equation}
%
The quantity $\Gamma^\tau_{\mu\nu}$ is known as the affine connection or displacement. It has three indices, i.e., entails $\tau$ possible combinations of $\mu \times \nu$ coefficients, which can vary arbitrarily from point to point, i.e., in the general case, are functions of $x_\nu$. Because in general $\Gtmn \neq \Gtnm$, the \Gtmn has $n \times n^2$ coefficients. If a vector $A^\tau$ is given at the point $P$ with coordinates \xn, \cref{eq:affine} yields the unknown components of the vector $A^{\ast\tau}$ at $P^*$ with coordinates $\xn+dx_\nu$. Continuing this process $
\xn+d\xn+d^{\ast} \xn+d^{\ast \ast} \xn \ldots$, we can parallel displace a vector from any given point to any other distant point. As is well known, the most characteristic feature of the operation of displacement is that if one parallel displaces $A^\tau$ along different paths, one gets, in general, a different vector $A^{\ast \tau}$ at a distant point:

It is naturally to assume that is symmetric. The displacement allows to establish whether two vectors are the \scare{same}, i.e., having the same length and the same direction. However, it does not provide a measure of the length of differently directed vectors. For this purpose, the notion of dot product of two vectors must be introduced, which, taking the components of the two vectors, returns a single number. In particular, the squared length $l$ of a vector is given by the dot product of the vector with itself $l^2$. In an arbitrary coordinate system, the latter takes the form:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:3}
l^2=\gmn A^\mu A^\nu\,,
\end{equation}
%
where the \gmn is the metric. If $A^\tau$ is considered to correspond to $dx_\nu$, \cref{eq:3} is nothing but \cref{eq:lineelement} and $l$ corresponds to $ds$. However, this notation is more general. One can take $A^\tau$ to be $dx^\nu/ds$, (where $ds$ is the \til interval, which is an element of the four-dimensional trajectory of a moving point), $l$ is the length of the four-velocity vector $u^\nu$. How much a vector varies, this is simple in the case that, covariant differentiation, a second term is necessary, that is that the covariant of the metric vanish


By imposing this condition, one obtains 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:riemannconnection}
\Gtmn=-\christoffel{\mu}{\nu}{\tau} =
\end{equation}
%

The components of \Gtmn have the same numerical values of the so-called Christoffel symbols of the second kind (up to a sign) because they are calculated from the metric \gmn and its first derivatives.




%\cop{Yet it is incorrect to conclude, like Weyl and Haas, that mathematics and physics are but one discipline. The question concerning the validity of axioms for the physical world must be distinguished from that concerning possible axiomatic systems. It is the merit of the theory of relativity that it removed the question of the truth of geometry from mathematics and relegated it to physics. If now, from a general geometry, theorems are derived and asserted to be a necessary foundation of physics, the old mistake is repeated. This objection must be made to Weyl's generalization of the theory of relativity which abandons altogether}.

%Der erste Punkt betrifft Herrn Dr. Reichenbach, dem ich möglichst schnell zu Habilitation verhelfen möchte.[2] Er hat dazu eine Arbeit: „Die Bedeutung der Re- lativitätstheorie für den physikalischen Erkenntnisbegriff“ eingereicht. Er sagte mir, dass Sie die Arbeit schon gelesen hätten, sodass ich sie Ihnen nicht zu schicken brauchte.[3] Ich muss nun sagen, dass meine eigene Erfahrung nicht hinreicht, um die Arbeit genügend zu würdigen und ich glaube ferner, dass Ihr Urteil über die Ar- beit bei der Hochschule hier sehr viel wiegen wird, sodass ich für den glatten Ver- lauf der Habilitation Günstiges erhoffe. Es wäre das deswegen besonders wertvoll, weil die Arbeit doch zum grossen Teil philosophischen Charakters ist, Herr Rei- chenbach sich aber für Physik habilitieren soll. Nun glaube ich, dass auch Sie mit mir übereinstimmen werden darin, dass gerade solche Arbeiten auch für den Phy- siker bei der augenblicklichen Entwicklung in der Physik sehr nützlich sind, sodass seine Arbeit auch dem Herrn Reichenbach zur Habilitation inder Physik dienen kann.

%The mechanism of adjustment is the only way to explain the surprising fact that electrons and hydrogen nuclei always have the same mass and charge, and thus the very existence of identical atoms, along with the possibly that these atoms, under given external conditions, settle into identical crystalline structures, that we can use as rods.

This was, after all, the general framework that, e.g. Mie (who also gave a talk at Bad Nauheim, Mie, 1920) had tried to realize without any success (cf. also footnote 5).

The importance of this formalism for \gr was to which was the key content of the theory. Let's conisder the four-velocity of a particle $u^\tau=d\xn/d\ap$. By parallel-displacing a vector $u^\tau$ indicating the direction of a curve $\xn(\ap)$ at any of its points, one can define a special class of curves, the straightest lines. The operation of parallel transporting a vector $u^\tau$ along a curve $x(\ap)$ is expressed by the condition that the covariant derivatives of $u^\tau$ with respect to the parameter \ap vanish along the curve: $\frac{d u^{\tau}}{d \ap}-\Gtmn u^{\mu} \frac{d x^\nu}{d\ap}=0$. The vector $u^\tau$ indicates the direction of the curve $x_\nu(\ap)$ at each point if its components are proportional to the increments $dx_\nu$ along the curve, \ie if $u^\tau=d\xn/d\ap$. The curve traced by the parallel displacement of $u^\tau$ along its own direction $d\xn/d\ap$ is the straightest curve. According to special relativity, a freely movable body not subjected to external forces moves, according to the special theory of relativity, in a straight line and uniformly with respect to an inertial coordinate system $K$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:geodesicelectro}
\frac{d^{2} x_{\tau}}{d s^{2}} = 0
\end{equation}

If \ap is the so-called \scare{proper time}, $u^\tau$ as the velocity four-vector of a particle, and $\frac{d {u^\tau}}{d\ap}$ its acceleration. If now consider from the of a we can, that this is ultimately. If chose a suitable coordinate system that the right had sight of the equation vanish. Then if we introduce new space-time co-ordinates $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}$, by means of any substitution we choose, the go in this new system will no longer be constants, but functions of space and time.

\begin{equation*}
\frac{d {u^\tau}}{d\ap} - \Gtmn u^{\mu} u^\nu =0 
\end{equation*}
 
According to the equivalence principle $K$ and $K'$ is however, indistinguisblae from $K$. All fall with the same velocity, thus the non vanisihig of the \gmn. If the $\Gamma_{\mu \nu}^{\tau}$ vanish, then the point moves uniformly in a straight line. These quantities therefore condition the deviation of the motion from uniformity. They are the components of the gravitational field.


\begin{equation}\label{eq:riemanntensorgamma}
R_{\mu \nu \sigma}^{\tau}(\Gamma)=\frac{\partial \Gamma_{\mu \nu}^{\tau}}{\partial x^{\sigma}}-\frac{\partial \Gamma_{\mu \sigma}^{\tau}}{\partial x^{\nu}}+\Gamma_{\alpha \nu}^{\tau} \Gamma_{\mu \sigma}^{\alpha}-\Gamma_{\alpha \sigma}^{\tau} \Gamma_{\mu\sigma}^{\alpha}\,, = 0
\end{equation}
%
In the general case how, so that without changing its components. The physical hypothesis on which general relativity is based, on the fundamental idea that valid also in the case in which does not vanish. This difference, curvature of space. The vector would not return with the same components.

This point is essential to Reichenbach's argument. It was precisely because his toy-geometrization was not envied by its more titled competitors that Reichenbach believed himself to be in an excellent position to \qt{attack the view that with a geometrical presentation of electricity, one would already gain something}{Ich wollte mich eben mit meiner Darstellung gegen die Auffassung wenden, als ob mit der geometrischen Darstellung der Elektrizität an sich schon etwas gewonnen wäre}[\letter{Reichenbach}{Einstein}{4}{4}{1926}][20-086][EA]. For such a geometrical interpretation of electromagnetism to become a physical theory as successful as general relativity, more was required than a mere geometrization. It called for something \emph{new}. Howeve,r in this cas eht egometrizajo did provide any sucecs. Of course if one could to reight field equatios, im particular than wuld ha bene trasitwryt.


%%Thus, Reichenbach argued that the geometrical interpretation of a physical field can only be successful if it leads to a \scare{change} in the equations and does not simply rewrite in geometrical terms the equations that are already known. One could object that Weyl, Eddington and Einstein's theories also changed the equations and did not simply rewrite them. However, Reichenbach seems to consider the derivability of solutions that correspond to the electron as a litmus test for a real change in the field equations. Maxwell's field equations are valid in free space and cannot explain why the separate, equally charged parts do not fly apart without introducing a non-electromagnetic cohesion force (the so-called Poincar\'{e} stress). On the other hand, Einstein's field equations, in their original form, do not entail any effect of gravitation on charge and cannot provide the cohesion force. It is only by changing the currently available field equations that it would become  possible to establish a connection between \gmn and $f\mn$, thereby assuring the equilibrium of the electron.
%
%To fully understand Reichenbach's stance on this issue, one must keep in mind that in a paper published in April \citep{Reichenbach1926} he expressed strong skepticism about the possibility of solving the problem of the \scare{grainy} structure of matter and and most all of the \qt{proper quantum-riddle}{eigentlichen Quantenrätsels}[][424][Reichenbach1926] in a field-theoretical/geometrical context. In Reichenbach's view, the \qt{casuality \origins{Zufälligkeit}}{Zufälligkeit}[][424][Reichenbach1926] of the \scare{quantum jumps} (the transition between orbital energy levels in Bohr's atom) suggests that the problem should be tackled from a different angle, by considering whether the very notion of causality in physics should be replaced by that of probability \citep[424]{Reichenbach1926}. After all, one should appreciate Reichenbach's clairvoyance, considering that Max Born's paper \citep{Born1926a} on the statistical interpretation of the wave function appeared only in June\footnote{For Reichenbach's take on the emerging quantum mechanics at this time, see the posthumously published manuscript, \cite{Reichenbach1926e}}.

I have now made a few reflections on the topic, which seem to me to prove that the Weylean thought, although good mathematically, does not bring about anything new physically. The geometrical interpretation of electricity is only a visualization, which in itself still does not say anything, and can also be realized in the original relativity theory. I have attached the note and would be grateful if you could give it a look \letter{Reichenbach}{Einstein}{24}{3}{26}][20-085][EA]}{Daß Sie meiner $\Gamma$-Kritik zustimmen, hat mich sehr gefreut \textelp{} Ich habe jetzt eine kleine Ueberlegung zu dieser Sache durchgeführt, die mir zu beweisen scheint, warum der Weylsche Gedanke, so gut er mathematisch ist, nichts Physikalisch Neues bringt.

Ich lege Ihnen die Note ein und wäre Ihnen für Durchsicht sehr dankbar}

%, after making some comments about his academic situation,



%Reichenbach attached to this letter a typewritten note. As we shall see, far more was at stake in it than a critique of Weyl's theory (which was generally considered a dead horse at the time). Reichenbach intended to call into question the very idea that, since general relativity has \scare{geometrized} the gravitational field, the obvious next move should be to try to \scare{geometrize} the electromagnetic field. The importance of this formalism for \gr was to which was the key content of the theory.
